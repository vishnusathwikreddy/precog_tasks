i to sherlock holmes she is always _the_ woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory
i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion
one night—it was on the twentieth of march 1888—i was returning from a journey to a patient (for i had now returned to civil practice) when my way led me through baker street as i passed the well-remembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own
his manner was not effusive it seldom was; but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you
seven i answered indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
then how do you know? i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?
my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out
he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together
it is simplicity itself said he; my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession
i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours
quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room
frequently how often? well some hundreds of times
then how many are there? how many? i dont know
quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud
the note was undated and without either signature or address
there will call upon you to-night at a quarter to eight oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask
this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means?
i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it?
i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written
the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff
peculiar—that is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light
i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper
what do you make of that? asked holmes
the name of the maker no doubt; or his monogram rather
not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitz—here we are egria it is in a german-speaking country—in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills ha ha my boy what do you make of that? his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
the paper was made in bohemia i said
precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence—this account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts
as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled
a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else
i think that i had better go holmes
not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it
but your client— never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention
a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap
come in said holmes a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy
you had my note? he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address
pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address?
you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone
i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me
the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history
i promise said holmes and i
you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own
i was aware of it said holmes dryly
the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia
i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes
our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client
if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you
the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried; i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it?
why indeed? murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel-felstein and hereditary king of bohemia
but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come _incognito_ from prague for the purpose of consulting you
then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more
the facts are briefly these: some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you
kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes
let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year 1858 contralto—hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsaw—yes retired from operatic stage—ha living in london—quite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back
precisely so but how— was there a secret marriage?
none no legal papers or certificates?
none then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity?
there is the writing pooh pooh forgery
my private note-paper stolen my own seal
imitated my photograph bought we were both in the photograph
oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
i was mad—insane you have compromised yourself seriously
i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now
it must be recovered we have tried and failed
your majesty must pay it must be bought
she will not sell stolen then
five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result
no sign of it? absolutely none
holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he
but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully
very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph?
to ruin me but how? i am about to be married
so i have heard to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
and irene adler? threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go—none
you are sure that she has not sent it yet?
i am sure and why? because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday
oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present?
certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm
then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress
pray do so i shall be all anxiety
then as to money? you have _carte blanche_
absolutely? i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
and for present expenses? the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table
there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said
holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him
and mademoiselles address? he asked is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood
holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet?
it was then good-night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and good-night watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you
ii at three oclock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight oclock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head
it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunken-looking groom ill-kempt and side-whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friends amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes
well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair
what is it? its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing
i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler
quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight oclock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a _bijou_ villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sitting-room on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest
i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half-and-half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to
and what of irene adler? i asked
oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentine-mews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine-mews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign
this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits? was she his client his friend or his mistress? if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation
i am following you closely i answered
i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustached—evidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home
he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross & hankeys in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes
away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for
the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes
this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twenty-five minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind
my cabby drove fast i dont think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me
thank god he cried youll do come come
what then? i asked come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal
i was half-dragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i; and what then?
well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements
which are? some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your co-operation
i shall be delighted you dont mind breaking the law?
not in the least nor running a chance of arrest?
not in a good cause oh the cause is excellent
then i am your man i was sure that i might rely on you
but what is it you wish?
when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her
and what then? you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand?
i am to be neutral? to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window
yes you are to watch me for i will be visible to you
yes and when i raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me?
entirely it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smoke-rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear?
i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street
precisely then you may entirely rely on me
that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play
he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime
it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissors-grinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths
you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph?
where indeed? it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her
where then? her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else? she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house
but it has twice been burgled
pshaw they did not know how to look
but how will you look? i will not look
what then? i will get her to show me
but she will refuse she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter
as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissors-grinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street
is the poor gentleman much hurt? she asked
he is dead cried several voices
no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital
hes a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now
he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm?
surely bring him into the sitting-room there is a comfortable sofa this way please
slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another
holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and ill—gentlemen ostlers and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road
you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right
you have the photograph? i know where it is
and how did you find out?
she showed me as i told you she would
i am still in the dark
i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening
i guessed as much then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick
that also i could fathom then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do? and into her sitting-room which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance
how did that help you? it was all-important when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little over-precipitance may ruin all
and now? i asked our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king to-morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands
and when will you call? at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay
we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
good-night mister sherlock holmes there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by
ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been
iii i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room
you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face
not yet but you have hopes?
i have hopes then come i am all impatience to be gone
we must have a cab no my brougham is waiting
then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge
irene adler is married remarked holmes
married when? yesterday but to whom?
to an english lawyer named norton
but she could not love him
i am in hopes that she does
and why in hopes? because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan
it is true and yet— well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue
the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham
mr sherlock holmes i believe? said she
i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze
indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from charing cross for the continent
what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england?
never to return and the papers? asked the king hoarsely all is lost
we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bell-pull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
my dear mr sherlock holmes—you really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departed
well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you good-night and started for the temple to see my husband
we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes
very truly yours irene norton _née_ adler
what a woman—oh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was? would she not have made an admirable queen? is it not a pity that she was not on my level?
from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion
on the contrary my dear sir cried the king; nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire
i am glad to hear your majesty say so
i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring— he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand
your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes
you have but to name it
this photograph the king stared at him in amazement
irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it
i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers
and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a womans wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of _the_ woman
ii the red-headed league i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout florid-faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me
you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially
i was afraid that you were engaged
so i am very much so
then i can wait in the next room
not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also
the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes
try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures
your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed
you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination
a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting
you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique
the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance
i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherds check trousers a not over-clean black frock-coat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features
sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else
mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion
how in the name of good-fortune did you know all that mr holmes? he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour its as true as gospel for i began as a ships carpenter
your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed
well the snuff then and the freemasonry?
i wont insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc-and-compass breastpin
ah of course i forgot that but the writing?
what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?
well but china? the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain the matter becomes even more simple
mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all
i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining _omne ignotum pro magnifico_ you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson?
yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir
i took the paper from him and read as follows:
to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania usa there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of £ 4 a week for purely nominal services all red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 7 popes court fleet street
what on earth does this mean? i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isnt it? said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date
it is _the morning chronicle_ of april 27 1890 just two months ago
very good now mr wilson? well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead; i have a small pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one; and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business
what is the name of this obliging youth? asked sherlock holmes
his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such a youth either its hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes; and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head?
why indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i dont know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement
oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole hes a good worker theres no vice in him
he is still with you i presume?
yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—thats all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more
the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says:
i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red-headed man
why that? i asks why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the red-headed men its worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres a nice little crib all ready for me to step into
why what is it then? i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stay-at-home man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat in that way i didnt know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news
have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men? he asked with his eyes open
never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies
and what are they worth? i asked
oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with ones other occupations
well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
tell me all about it said i
well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself red-headed and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do
but said i there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply
not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds
now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement
i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with red-headed folk and popes court looked like a costers orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they were—straw lemon orange brick irish-setter liver clay; but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office
your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement
there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us
this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league
and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success
it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobblers wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager
my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson? have you a family?
i answered that i had not
his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor
my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right
in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?
well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i
oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you
what would be the hours? i asked
ten to two now a pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up
that would suit me very well said i and the pay?
is £ 4 a week and the work?
is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal?
well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time
its only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i
no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross; neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet
and the work? is to copy out the _encyclopædia britannica_ there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blotting-paper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready to-morrow?
certainly i answered then good-bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune
well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the _encyclopædia britannica_ vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill-pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for popes court
well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he bade me good-day complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me
this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it
eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the bs before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end
to an end? yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself
he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper it read in this fashion:
the red-headed league is dissolved october 9 1890
sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter
i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere
no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldnt miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?
i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red-headed league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him
well said i the gentleman at no 4
what the red-headed man? yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday
where could i find him? oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 17 king edward street near st pauls
i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross
and what did you do then? asked holmes
i went home to saxe-coburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you
and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear
grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week
as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some £ 30 to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them
no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds
we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?
about a month then how did he come?
in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant?
no i had a dozen why did you pick him?
because he was handy and would come cheap
at half wages in fact yes
what is he like this vincent spaulding?
small stout-built very quick in his ways no hair on his face though hes not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?
yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad
hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you?
oh yes sir; i have only just left him
and has your business been attended to in your absence?
nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of a morning
that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two to-day is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion
well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all?
i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business
as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter
what are you going to do then? i asked
to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson? could your patients spare you for a few hours?
i have nothing to do to-day my practice is never very absorbing
then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along
we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk took us to saxe-coburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabby-genteel place where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a bright-looking clean-shaven young fellow who asked him to step in
thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand
third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door
smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before
evidently said i mr wilsons assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red-headed league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him
not him what then? the knees of his trousers
and what did you see? what i expected to see
why did you beat the pavement?
my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxe-coburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it
the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted
let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriage-building depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin-land where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums
my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth-hound holmes the relentless keen-witted ready-handed criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down
you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged
yes it would be as well
and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious
why serious? a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but to-day being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help to-night
at what time? ten will be early enough
i shall be at baker street at ten
very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd
i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the _encyclopædia_ down to the visit to saxe-coburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed? where were we going and what were we to do? i had the hint from holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbrokers assistant was a formidable man—a man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation
it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sad-faced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat
ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard? let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in to-nights adventure
were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down
i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily
you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he wont mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force
oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my rubber
i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some £ 30000; and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands
john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london hes a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself hell crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet
i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second
sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into farrington street
we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us
we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earth-smelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes
you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him
nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise
i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere?
the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket
we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it
your french gold? yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30000 napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern
and sit in the dark? i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a _partie carrée_ you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemys preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down
i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moments notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault
they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxe-coburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones?
i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door
then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait
what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones
its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a clean-cut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags? great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it
sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all
so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat-tails
there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes
oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you
and i you holmes answered your red-headed idea was very new and effective
youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies
i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please
all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police-station?
that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective
really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience
i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league
you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the _encyclopædia_ must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplices hair the £ 4 a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands? they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation
but how could you guess what the motive was?
had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the mans business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be? i thought of the assistants fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more? i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building
so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen
and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night? i asked
well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presence—in other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night
you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true
it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so
and you are a benefactor of the race said i
he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked _lhomme cest rien—lœuvre cest tout_ as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand
iii a case of identity my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the cross-purposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most _outré_ results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable
and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic
a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace
i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but here—i picked up the morning paper from the ground—let us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husbands cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example
he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it
ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers
and the ring? i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger
it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems
and have you any on hand just now? i asked with interest
some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken
he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell
i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an _affaire de cœur_ she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts
as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him
do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?
i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad good-humoured face youve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that?
never mind said holmes laughing; it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me?
i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me im not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel
why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry? asked sherlock holmes with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling
again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibank—that is my father—took it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you
your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different
yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself
and your mother is alive? oh yes mother is alive and well i wasnt best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman; but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest which wasnt near as much as father could have got if he had been alive
i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
your own little income he asked does it come out of the business?
oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying 4½ per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest
you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60
i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i dont wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day
you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel
a flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat but this time i was set on going and i would go; for what right had he to prevent? he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all fathers friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel
i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball
oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way
i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel
yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met him—that is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more
no? well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet
but how about mr hosmer angel? did he make no attempt to see you?
well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know
were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?
oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmer—mr angel—was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street—and—
what office? thats the worst of it mr holmes i dont know
where did he live then? he slept on the premises
and you dont know his address?
no—except that it was leadenhall street
where did you address your letters then?
to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of
it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel?
he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare
well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france?
mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didnt quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me; but i didnt want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
it missed him then? yes sir; for he had started to england just before it arrived
ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church?
yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him
it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes
oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it
most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?
yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened
but you have no notion as to what it could have been?
none one more question how did your mother take the matter?
she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again
and your father? did you tell him?
yes; and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me? now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened? and why could he not write? oh it drives me half-mad to think of it and i cant sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it
i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life
then you dont think ill see him again?
i fear not then what has happened to him?
you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare
i advertised for him in last saturdays _chronicle_ said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him
thank you and your address? no 31 lyon place camberwell
mr angels address you never had i understand where is your fathers place of business?
he travels for westhouse & marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street
thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life
you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back
for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned
sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face
quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in 77 and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive
you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked
not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumb-nails or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace now what did you gather from that womans appearance? describe it
well she had a slate-coloured broad-brimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didnt observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar comfortable easy-going way
sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled
pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a womans sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewing-machine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her
it surprised me but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots half-buttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry
and what else? i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friends incisive reasoning
i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel?
i held the little printed slip to the light missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height; strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frock-coat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing &c &c
that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you
they are typewritten i remarked not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact we may call it conclusive
of what? my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?
i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted
no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six oclock to-morrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
i had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph; but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel
i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland
a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six oclock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and test-tubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him
well have you solved it? i asked as i entered
yes it was the bisulphate of baryta
no no the mystery i cried
oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel
who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland?
the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in
the man who entered was a sturdy middle-sized fellow some thirty years of age clean-shaven and sallow-skinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
good-evening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six oclock?
yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel?
on the contrary said holmes quietly; i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel
mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said
it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a mans handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious
we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes
and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well
mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it
certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him
what where? shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap
oh it wont do—really it wont said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question thats right sit down and let us talk it over
our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow it—its not actionable he stammered
i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong
the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us
the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then? he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself
it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away
very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank
our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint
the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but heres a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to— he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
theres a cold-blooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest
i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked
well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction
and how did you verify them?
having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse & marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employé james windibank _voilà tout_
and miss sutherland? if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world
iv the boscombe valley mystery we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way:
have you a couple of days to spare? have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the 11:15
what do you say dear? said my wife looking across at me will you go?
i really dont know what to say i have a fairly long list at present
oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases
i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour
my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap
it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets
we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of note-taking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack
have you heard anything of the case? he asked
not a word i have not seen a paper for some days
the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult
that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
it is a murder then? well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words
boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an ex-australian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl turner had a considerable household some half-dozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts
on june 3rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his serving-man in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive
from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a game-keeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred
the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the game-keeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his sons gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court
i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here
circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home
i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case
there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that
how on earth— my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my _métier_ and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering
what are they? it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroners jury
it was a confession i ejaculated
no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence
coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark
on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one
i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked
so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged
what is the young mans own account of the matter?
it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself
he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way:
mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows: i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the 3rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the game-keeper as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than 150 yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodge-keeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter
the coroner: did your father make any statement to you before he died?
witness: he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat
the coroner: what did you understand by that?
witness: it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious
the coroner: what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?
witness: i should prefer not to answer
the coroner: i am afraid that i must press it
witness: it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed
the coroner: that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise
witness: i must still refuse the coroner: i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father?
witness: it was the coroner: how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol?
witness (with considerable confusion): i do not know
a juryman: did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?
witness: nothing definite the coroner: what do you mean?
witness: i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone
do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?
yes it was gone  you cannot say what it was?
no i had a feeling something was there
how far from the body? a dozen yards or so
and how far from the edge of the wood?
about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?
yes but with my back towards it
this concluded the examination of the witness
i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son
holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes
it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross a lean ferret-like man furtive and sly-looking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us
i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime
it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure
lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said
how is the glass? twenty-nine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to-night
lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one cant refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door
he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a womans quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didnt do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him
i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can
but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion? do you not see some loophole some flaw? do you not yourself think that he is innocent?
i think that it is very probable
there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes
lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said
but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it
in what way? asked holmes it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet and—and—well he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them
and your father? asked holmes was he in favour of such a union?
no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her
thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call to-morrow?
i am afraid the doctor wont allow it
the doctor? yes have you not heard? poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria
ha in victoria that is important
yes at the mines quite so; at the gold-mines where as i understand mr turner made his money
yes certainly thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me
you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent
i will miss turner i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him good-bye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street
i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? i am not over-tender of heart but i call it cruel
i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison?
yes but only for you and me
then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to-night?
ample then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours
i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade? it was something terrible and deadly what could it be? might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeons deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could that mean? it could not be delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indicate? i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthys innocence
it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy
and what did you learn from him?
nothing could he throw no light?
none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quick-witted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart
i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner
ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boarding-school what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office? no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered
but if he is innocent who has done it?
ah who? i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow
there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool
there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of
an elderly man i presume? said holmes
about sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthys and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free
indeed that is interesting said holmes
oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him
really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that?
we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies
you are right said holmes demurely; you do find it very hard to tackle the facts
anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth
and that is— that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine
well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left
yes that is it it was a widespread comfortable-looking building two-storied slate-roofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the court-yard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool
sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end
the boscombe pool which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion
what did you go into the pool for? he asked
i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth—
oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then? it is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening and this? ha ha what have we here? tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come again—of course that was for the cloak now where did they come from? he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad where all traces were lost
it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently
it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood
this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it
i see no marks there are none
how do you know then? the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon
and the murderer? is a tall man left-handed limps with the right leg wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigar-holder and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hard-headed british jury
_nous verrons_ answered holmes calmly you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train
and leave your case unfinished? no finished
but the mystery? it is solved
who was the criminal then? the gentleman i describe
but who is he? surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood
lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughing-stock of scotland yard
all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings good-bye i shall drop you a line before i leave
having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position
look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i dont know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound
pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
what of this cooee then? well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia
what of the rat then? sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read?
arat i read and now? he raised his hand
ballarat quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat
it is wonderful i exclaimed it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the sons statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak
certainly and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
quite so then comes our expedition of to-day by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal
but how did you gain them?
you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles
his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces
yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness?
the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why? because he limped—he was lame
but his left-handedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam
and the cigar-holder? i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen-knife
holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is—
mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sitting-room and ushering in a visitor
the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep-lined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note?
yes the lodge-keeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
i thought people would talk if i went to the hall
and why did you wish to see me? he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered
yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy
the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes
i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely
i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested
it may not come to that said holmes
what? i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however
i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol
holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed
its as well said the old man; its a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell
you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how i came to be in his power
it was in the early 60s at the diggings i was a young chap then hot-blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything; i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang
one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me
i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot
here we are jack says he touching me on the arm; well be as good as a family to you theres two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you dont—its a fine law-abiding country is england and theres always a policeman within hail
well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness; turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice
his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over
when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond? i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son; but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred
well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation
i pray not sir and what do you intend to do?
in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room
god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms? i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxters words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes
james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past
v the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years 82 and 90 i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up
the year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque _sophy anderson_ of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe
it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great hand-made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russells fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mothers and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street
why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come to-night? some friend of yours perhaps?
except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors
a client then? if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landladys
sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit
come in said he the man who entered was young some two-and-twenty at the outside well-groomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety
i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the south-west i see
yes from horsham that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive
i have come for advice that is easily got
and help that is not always so easy
i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal
ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
he said that you could solve anything
he said too much that you are never beaten
i have been beaten four times—three times by men and once by a woman
but what is that compared with the number of your successes?
it is true that i have been generally successful
then you may be so with me
i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
it is no ordinary one none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal
and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important
the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze
my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair
you must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence
my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quick-tempered very foul-mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother
he didnt mind me; in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year 1878 after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumber-room up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boys curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room
one day—it was in march 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be? opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me
what is it uncle? i cried
death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror? i left the breakfast-table and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other
they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to-day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer
i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope
i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing but i cant say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you
i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin
well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little green-scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some £ 14000 which lay to his credit at the bank
one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide
the letter arrived on march 10 1883 his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may 2nd
thank you pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncles life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the north
well it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of 85 on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself
why what on earth does this mean john? he stammered
my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i
he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them?
put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder
what papers? what sundial? he asked
the sundial in the garden there is no other said i; but the papers must be those that are destroyed
pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from?
from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark
some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers? i shall take no notice of such nonsense
i should certainly speak to the police i said
and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort
then let me do so? no i forbid you i wont have a fuss made about such nonsense
it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings
on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalk-pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him
in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it? i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another
it was in january 85 that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father
the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips
this is the envelope he continued the postmark is london—eastern division within are the very words which were upon my fathers last message: k k k; and then put the papers on the sundial
what have you done? asked holmes
nothing nothing? to tell the truth—he sank his face into his thin white hands—i have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against
tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair
i have seen the police ah
but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings
holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried
they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me
has he come with you to-night?
no his orders were to stay in the house
again holmes raved in the air
why did you come to me? he said and above all why did you not come at once?
i did not know it was only to-day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you
it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?
there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured blue-tinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncles
holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march 1869 and beneath were the following enigmatical notices:
4th hudson came same old platform
7th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st augustine
9th mccauley cleared 10th john swain cleared
12th visited paramore all well thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act
what shall i do? there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand?
entirely do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise
do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back?
by train from waterloo it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
i am armed that is well to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case
i shall see you at horsham then?
no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it
then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more
sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling
i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this
save perhaps the sign of four
well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos
but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?
there can be no question as to their nature he answered
then what are they? who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family?
sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his finger-tips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclopædias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion
yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violin-player boxer swordsman lawyer and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis
holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the _american encyclopædia_ which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters?
the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london
from east london what do you deduce from that?
they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship
excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything?
a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come
then i do not see the point
there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
it is possible more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay
good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution?
the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroners jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society
but of what society? have you never— said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voice—have you never heard of the ku klux klan?
i never have holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently:
ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year 1869 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date
you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered
then the page we have seen—
is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and c—that is sent the societys warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down
you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he; i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaws
what steps will you take? i asked
it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all
you will not go there first?
no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee
as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart
holmes i cried you are too late
ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done? he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved
my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account:
between nine and ten last night police-constable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers-by it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the water-police the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages
we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him
that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death— he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands
they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there? the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now
to the police? no; i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before
all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water
you are hungry i remarked starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast
nothing? not a bite i had no time to think of it
and how have you succeeded? well
you have a clue? i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them it is well thought of
what do you mean? he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque _lone star_ savannah georgia
that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him
and who is this captain calhoun?
the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first
how did you trace it then?
he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names
i have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in 83 there were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the _lone star_ instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union
texas i think i was not and am not sure which; but i knew that the ship must have an american origin
what then? i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque _lone star_ was there in january 85 my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london
yes? the _lone star_ had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight
what will you do then? oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only native-born americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailing-ship reaches savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder
there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the _lone star_ of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the _lone star_
vi the man with the twisted lip
isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read de quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pin-point pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man
one night—it was in june 89—there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment
a patient said she youll have to go out
i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day
we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some dark-coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room
you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her self-control she ran forward threw her arms about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in such trouble she cried; i do so want a little help
why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in
i didnt know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse
it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed?
oh no no i want the doctors advice and help too its about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him
it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husbands trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was? was it possible that we could bring him back to her?
it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do? how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place? and then as a second thought why should she come at all? i was isa whitneys medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be
but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slop-shop and a gin-shop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire
as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth
thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him
there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me
my god its watson said he he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what oclock is it?
nearly eleven of what day? of friday june 19th
good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what dyou want to frighten a chap for? he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key
i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself
so i am but youve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipes—i forget how many but ill go home with you i wouldnt frighten kate—poor little kate give me your hand have you a cab?
yes i have one waiting then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself
i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering loose-lipped senility
holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den?
as low as you can he answered; i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you
i have a cab outside then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes
it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitneys bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter
i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opium-smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views
i was certainly surprised to find you there
but not more so than i to find you
i came to find a friend
and i to find an enemy
an enemy? yes; one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hours purchase; for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trap-door at the back of that building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights
what you do not mean bodies?
ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had £ 1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs
now watson said holmes as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns youll come with me wont you?
if i can be of use
oh a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a double-bedded one
the cedars? yes; that is mr st clairs house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry
where is it then? near lee in kent we have a seven-mile drive before us
but i am all in the dark
of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up here all right john; we shall not need you heres half a crown look out for me to-morrow about eleven give her her head so long then
he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best
you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door
you forget that i know nothing about it
i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but i cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me
proceed then some years ago—to be definite in may 1884—there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the 5:14 from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirty-seven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to £ 88 10_s_ while he has £ 220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind
last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me to-night mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office got her packet and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far?
it is very clear if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a second-floor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie
convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the steps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to-night—and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare good-fortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascade of childrens bricks it was the toy which he had promised to bring home
this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watch—all were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentlemans clothes
so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the left-hand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest
but a cripple said i what could he have done single-handed against a man in the prime of life?
he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
pray continue your narrative mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve but he pointed to his ring-finger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the police-station while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue
and it did though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets?
i cannot imagine no i dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river
but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone?
no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then? it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared
it certainly sounds feasible well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solved—what neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties
while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows
we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees? that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet
but why are you not conducting the case from baker street? i asked
because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa
we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stable-boy had run out to the horses head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding gravel-drive which led to the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one half-raised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question
well? she cried well? and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders
no good news? none no bad?
no thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day
this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation
i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us
my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy
now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer
certainly madam do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion
upon what point? in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive?
sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair
frankly then madam i do not
you think that he is dead?
i do murdered? i dont say that perhaps
and on what day did he meet his death?
on monday then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to-day
sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised
what he roared yes to-day she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air
may i see it? certainly he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight
coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husbands writing madam
no but the enclosure is i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address
how can you tell that? the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blotting-paper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here
yes there was a ring his signet-ring
and you are sure that this is your husbands hand?
one of his hands one? his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well
dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patience—neville written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book octavo size no water-mark hum posted to-day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands hand madam?
none neville wrote those words and they were posted to-day at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over
but he must be alive mr holmes
unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him
no no; it is it is his very own writing
very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted to-day
that is possible if so much may have happened between
oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?
i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you?
i cannot imagine it is unthinkable
and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you?
no and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane?
very much so was the window open?
yes then he might have called to you?
he might he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry?
yes a call for help you thought?
yes he waved his hands but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?
it is possible and you thought he was pulled back?
he disappeared so suddenly he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room?
no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs
quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on?
but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat
had he ever spoken of swandam lane?
never had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?
never thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day to-morrow
a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressing-gown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself cross-legged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night
awake watson? he asked yes game for a morning drive?
certainly then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stable-boy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twenty-five minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse
i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now
and where is it? i asked smiling
in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock
we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and trap with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream
it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all
in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in
who is on duty? asked holmes
inspector bradstreet sir ah bradstreet how are you? a tall stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet
certainly mr holmes step into my room here
it was a small office-like room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his desk
what can i do for you mr holmes?
i called about that beggarman boone—the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee
yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries
so i heard you have him here?
in the cells is he quiet?
oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel
dirty? yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinkers well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath; and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it
i should like to see him very much
would you? that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag
no i think that ill take it
very good come this way if you please he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through
he is asleep said he you can see him very well
we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middle-sized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
hes a beauty isnt he? said the inspector
he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bath-sponge
he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector
now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
well i dont know why not said the inspector he doesnt look a credit to the bow street cells does he? he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the water-jug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoners face
let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent
never in my life have i seen such a sight the mans face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sad-faced refined-looking man black-haired and smooth-skinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow
great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph
the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i charged with?
with making away with mr neville st— oh come you cant be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin well i have been twenty-seven years in the force but this really takes the cake
if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained
no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife
it was not the wife; it was the children groaned the prisoner god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do?
sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder
if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all
god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my adventures started it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the green-room for my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26_s_ 4_d_
i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for £ 25 i was at my wits end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnights grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt
well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at £ 2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession
well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn £ 700 a year—which is less than my average takings—but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take £ 2
as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had business in the city she little knew what
last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wifes eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer
i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear
that note only reached her yesterday said holmes
good god what a week she must have spent
the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days
that was it said holmes nodding approvingly; i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging?
many times; but what was a fine to me?
it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone
i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take
in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results
i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast
vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle
i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
you are engaged said i; perhaps i interrupt you
not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial one—he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat—but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction
i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such
so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime
precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire?
yes it is to him that this trophy belongs
it is his hat no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons fire the facts are these: about four oclock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose
which surely he restored to their owner?
my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them
what then did peterson do? he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner
did he not advertise? no then what clue could you have as to his identity?
only as much as we can deduce
from his hat? precisely but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt?
here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?
i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no makers name; but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink
i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend
on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences
then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?
he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him
my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of self-respect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middle-aged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with lime-cream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house
you are certainly joking holmes not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained?
i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?
for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is a question of cubic capacity said he; a man with so large a brain must have something in it
the decline of his fortunes then?
this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world
well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression?
sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect
your reasoning is certainly plausible the further points that he is middle-aged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses lime-cream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hair-ends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training
but his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him
this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes affection
but he might be a bachelor
nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife remember the card upon the birds leg
you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house?
one tallow stain or even two might come by chance; but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow—walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet are you satisfied?
well it is very ingenious said i laughing; but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy
sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment
the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped
eh? what of it then? has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window? holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the mans excited face
see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand
sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got?
a diamond sir? a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty
its more than a precious stone it is _the_ precious stone
not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle i ejaculated
precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in _the times_ every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of £ 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price
a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us
that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked
precisely so on december 22nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys jewel-case the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph:
hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner 26 plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst abstracted from the jewel-case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upper-attendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressing-room of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressing-table ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court
hum so much for the police-court said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone; the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods
what will you say? give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then: found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221b baker street that is clear and concise
very but will he see it?
well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers
in which sir? oh in the _globe_ _star_ _pall mall_ _st jamess gazette_ _evening news_ _standard_ _echo_ and any others that occur to you
very well sir and this stone?
ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring
when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light its a bonny thing said he just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriol-throwing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison? ill lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it
do you think that this man horner is innocent?
i cannot tell well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter?
it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement
and you can do nothing until then?
nothing in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business
very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop
i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after half-past six when i found myself in baker street once more as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room
mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker?
yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat
he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune
we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise
our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them
very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it
to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well?
oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief
of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish—
the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard
sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose
certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museum—we are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way
so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson?
not particularly then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot
by all means it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced white-aproned landlord
your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he
my geese the man seemed surprised
yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club
ah yes i see but you see sir thems not _our_ geese
indeed whose then? well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden
indeed? i know some of them which was it?
breckinridge is his name ah i dont know him well heres your good health landlord and prosperity to your house good-night
now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march
we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horsey-looking man with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters
good-evening its a cold night said holmes
the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble
let you have five hundred to-morrow morning
thats no good well there are some on the stall with the gas-flare
ah but i was recommended to you
who by? the landlord of the alpha
oh yes; i sent him a couple of dozen
fine birds they were too now where did you get them from?
to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at? lets have it straight now
it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha
well then i shant tell you so now
oh it is a matter of no importance; but i dont know why you should be so warm over such a trifle
warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business; but its where are the geese? and who did you sell the geese to? and what will you take for the geese? one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them
well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you wont tell us the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred
well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped the salesman
its nothing of the kind i say it is
i dont believe it dyou think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper? i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred
youll never persuade me to believe that
will you bet then? its merely taking your money for i know that i am right but ill have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate
the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he
the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy-backed one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish youll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book?
well? thats the list of the folk from whom i buy dyou see? well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink? well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me
mrs oakshott 117 brixton road—249 read holmes
quite so now turn that up in the ledger
holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott 117 brixton road egg and poultry supplier
now then whats the last entry?
december 22nd twenty-four geese at 7_s_ 6_d_
quite so there you are and underneath?
sold to mr windigate of the alpha at 12_s_
what have you to say now?
sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him
when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he i daresay that if i had put £ 100 down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott to-night or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should—
his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure
ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with it? did i buy the geese off you?
no; but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man
well then ask mrs oakshott for it
she told me to ask you
well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care ive had enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang round and i could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
who are you then? what do you want? he asked in a quavering voice
you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you
you? who are you? how could you know anything of the matter?
my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people dont know
but you can know nothing of this?
excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member
oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter
sherlock holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting
the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance
no no; the real name said holmes sweetly it is always awkward doing business with an alias
a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder
precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know
the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened half-hopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him
here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basket-chair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese?
yes sir or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interested—white with a black bar across the tail
ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to?
it came here here? yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i dont wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum
our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant many-pointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it
the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure
for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcars?
it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice
i see—her ladyships waiting-maid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then? you made some small job in my ladys room—you and your confederate cusack—and you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewel-case raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then—
ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it ill swear it on a bible oh dont bring it into court for christs sake dont
get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing
i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down
hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market? tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety
ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sisters house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale; but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do
i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him; so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety? i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived
my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birds—a fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others
whatever were you doing with that bird jem? says she
well said i you said youd give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest
oh says she weve set yours aside for you—jems bird we call it its the big white one over yonder theres twenty-six of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market
thank you maggie says i; but if it is all the same to you id rather have that one i was handling just now
the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you
never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said i
oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then?
that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock
oh very well kill it and take it with you
well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there
where are they all maggie? i cried
gone to the dealers jem which dealers?
breckinridge of covent garden but was there another with a barred tail? i asked the same as the one i chose?
yes jem; there were two barred-tailed ones and i could never tell them apart
well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves to-night well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and now—and now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands
there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes finger-tips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door
get out said he what sir oh heaven bless you
no more words get out and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street
after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaol-bird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature
viii the adventure of the speckled band
on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace; for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth
it was early in april in the year 83 that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits
very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you
what is it then—a fire? no; a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sitting-room now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance
my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything
i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered
good-morning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering
it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested
what then? it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick all-comprehensive glances
you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see
you know me then? no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart along heavy roads before you reached the station
the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion
there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver
whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer; i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to—none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes; i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful
holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small case-book which he consulted
farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter
alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
i am all attention madam my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey
holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he
the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the two-hundred-year-old house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man
when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of major-general stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mothers re-marriage she had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness
but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfathers case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the police-court until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger
last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master
you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has
your sister is dead then? she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half-pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion
sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor
pray be precise as to details said he
it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manor-house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain?
perfectly so the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back
tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?
never said i i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep?
certainly not but why? because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it
no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation
very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also
ah but i sleep more heavily than you
well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock
indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?
always and why? i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked
quite so pray proceed with your statement
i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sisters voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horror-stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridor-lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctors room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown when he reached my sisters side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? could you swear to it?
that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived
was your sister dressed? no she was in her night-dress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match-box
showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to?
he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her
how about poison? the doctors examined her for it but without success
what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then?
it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine
were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?
yes there are nearly always some there
ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled band?
sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used
holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied
these are very deep waters said he; pray go on with your narrative
two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitage—percy armitage—the second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog-cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all?
yes all miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather
why what do you mean? for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist
you have been cruelly used said holmes
the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire
this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to-day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?
as it happens he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way
excellent you are not averse to this trip watson?
by no means then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself?
i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to be there in time for your coming
and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast?
no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
and what do you think of it all watson? asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair
it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business
dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?
i cannot think when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines
but what then did the gipsies do?
i cannot imagine i see many objections to any such theory
and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil
the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black top-hat a long frock-coat and a pair of high gaiters with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deep-set bile-shot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
which of you is holmes? asked this apparition
my name sir; but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly
i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran
indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat
i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you?
it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes
what has she been saying to you? screamed the old man furiously
but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably
ha you put me off do you? said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler
my friend smiled holmes the busybody
his smile broadened holmes the scotland yard jack-in-office
holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught
i will go when i have had my say dont you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room
he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again
fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures
i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wifes death was little short of £ 1100 is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than £ 750 each daughter can claim an income of £ 250 in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eleys no 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth-brush are i think all that we need
at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows
look there said he a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion
stoke moran? said he yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver
there is some building going on there said holmes; that is where we are going
theres the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; but if you want to get to the house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking
and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest
we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead
i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip good-afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word
our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened
good heavens she cried he has followed me then
so it appears he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns?
he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him to-night if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
the building was of grey lichen-blotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the right-hand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stone-work had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main building to dr roylotts chamber?
exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one
pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall
there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course?
yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through
as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?
miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country-houses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window these articles with two small wicker-work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown worm-eaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment
where does that bell communicate with? he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
it goes to the housekeepers room
it looks newer than the other things?
yes it was only put there a couple of years ago
your sister asked for it i suppose?
no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves
indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug
why its a dummy said he
wont it ring? no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is
how very absurd i never noticed that before
very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air
that is also quite modern said the lady
done about the same time as the bell-rope? remarked holmes
yes there were several little changes carried out about that time
they seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy bell-ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment
dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter but was as plainly furnished a camp-bed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest
whats in here? he asked tapping the safe
my stepfathers business papers oh you have seen inside then?
only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers
there isnt a cat in it for example?
no what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it
no; we dont keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon
ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting
the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord
what do you make of that watson?
its a common enough lash but i dont know why it should be tied
that is not quite so common is it? ah me its a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn
i had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie
it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect
i shall most certainly do so
the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance
i assure you that i am in your hands
in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room
both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment
yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there?
yes that is the crown very good your windows would be visible from there?
certainly you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands
but what will you do? we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you
i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve
perhaps i have then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters death
i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak
you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain good-bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms
do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you to-night there is a distinct element of danger
can i be of assistance? your presence might be invaluable
then i shall certainly come it is very kind of you
you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me
no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did
i saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine
you saw the ventilator too? yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through
i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran
my dear holmes oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroners inquiry i deduced a ventilator
but what harm can there be in that?
well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you?
i cannot as yet see any connection
did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?
no it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?
i cannot say that i have
the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull
holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful
about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us
that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet; it comes from the middle window
as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand
there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
my god i whispered; did you see it?
holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon
i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words:
the least sound would be fatal to our plans
i nodded to show that i had heard
we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator
i nodded again do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness
how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil? i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat open-eyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness
from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall
suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audible—a very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull
you see it watson? he yelled you see it?
but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose
what can it mean? i gasped
it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylotts room
with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand
it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion
the band the speckled band whispered holmes
i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
it is a swamp adder cried holmes; the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead mans lap and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it
such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day
i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharp-eyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim
i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it
with the result of driving it through the ventilator
and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylotts death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience
ix the adventure of the engineers thumb
of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice—that of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect
it was in the summer of 89 not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence
one morning at a little before seven oclock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him
ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder; hes all right
what is it then? i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room
its a new patient he whispered i thought id bring him round myself; then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor; i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him
i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than five-and-twenty i should say with a strong masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control
i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the side-table
i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer 16a victoria street (3rd floor) that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my library-chair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation
oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh
stop it i cried; pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe
it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and pale-looking
i have been making a fool of myself he gasped
not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be
he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably
yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig
excellent you should have been a surgeon
it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province
this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument
a thing like a cleaver said he
an accident i presume? by no means
what a murderous attack? very murderous indeed
you horrify me i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time
how is that? i asked when i had finished
capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through
perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves
oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police; but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done
ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police
oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him?
ill do better ill take you round to him myself
i should be immensely obliged to you
well call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it?
yes; i shall not feel easy until i have told my story
then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street
sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown reading the agony column of _the times_ and smoking his before-breakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant
thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us
you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner & matheson the well-known firm of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor fathers death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street
i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to £ 27 10_s_ every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all
yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty
mr hatherley? said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret
i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character?
well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london
that is quite correct i answered; but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?
undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essential—absolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family
if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so
he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye
do you promise then? said he at last
yes i promise absolute and complete silence before during and after? no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing?
i have already given you my word
very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty
thats all right said he coming back i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience
i beg that you will state your business sir said i; my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips
how would fifty guineas for a nights work suit you? he asked
most admirably i say a nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that?
the work appears to be light and the pay munificent
precisely so we shall want you to come to-night by the last train
where to? to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15
very good i shall come down in a carriage to meet you
there is a drive then? yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good seven miles from eyford station
then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop the night
yes we could easily give you a shake-down
that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient hour?
we have judged it best that you should come late it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so
i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do
quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?
entirely then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fullers-earth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england?
i have heard so some little time ago i bought a small place—a very small place—within ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fullers-earth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left—both of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford to-night i hope that i make it all plain?
i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fullers-earth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit
ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at 11:15
i shall certainly be there and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room
well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fullers-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue
at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dim-lit station after eleven oclock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the wood-work and away we went as fast as the horse could go
one horse? interjected holmes yes only one
did you observe the colour? yes i saw it by the side-lights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut
tired-looking or fresh? oh fresh and glossy
thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement
away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away
it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand
perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness
i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange out-of-the-way place? and where was the place? i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee
suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her
i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly; i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do
but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine
it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door; no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late
but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i thought of my fifty-guinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing? why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due? this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come
the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson
this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught
on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close
he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine
i had better put my hat on i suppose
oh no it is in the house
what you dig fullers-earth in the house?
no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it
we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman
colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in
we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right
i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fullers-earth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
what are you doing there? he asked
i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me i was admiring your fullers-earth said i; i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used
the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes
very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out
and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps; and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart
i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay half-fainting upon the other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape
i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected
come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the so-precious time but come
this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wits end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly
it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it
as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butchers cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were ill-used then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back
fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent
you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below
i was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes
how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my nights adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me? no he had not was there a police-station anywhere near? there was one about three miles off
it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise
we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings
here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this: lost on the 9th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twenty-six a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten oclock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy
good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl said
undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those out-and-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford
some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plain-clothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre
there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that line you said ten miles i think sir
it was an hours good drive
and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious?
they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere
what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties
i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life
oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found
i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly
really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there
and i say east said my patient
i am for west remarked the plain-clothes man there are several quiet little villages up there
and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any
come cried the inspector laughing; its a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to?
you are all wrong but we cant all be
oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them
but the twelve-mile drive? gasped hatherley
six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?
indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang
none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver
we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough
but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
a house on fire? asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way
yes sir said the station-master when did it break out?
i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze
whose house is it? dr bechers
tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose?
the station-master laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isnt a man in the parish who has a better-lined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm
the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the gravel-drive and there are the rose-bushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from
well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now
and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts
the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out-house but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to
how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty-guinea fee and what have i gained?
experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of value you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence
x the adventure of the noble bachelor
the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode
it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends noble correspondent could be
here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered your morning letters if i remember right were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter
yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie
he broke the seal and glanced over the contents
oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all
not social then? no distinctly professional
and from a noble client? one of the highest in england
my dear fellow i congratulate you
i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not?
it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner i have had nothing else to do
it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding?
oh yes with the deepest interest
that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he says:
my dear mr sherlock holmes—lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance i will call at four oclock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance yours faithfully
robert st simon it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle
he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an hour
then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is he picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms: azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in 1846 hes forty-one years of age which is mature for marriage was under-secretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid
i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters
oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up now—though indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections
here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the _morning post_ and dates as you see some weeks back: a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal usa that is all
terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire
there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is: there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress
anything else? asked holmes yawning oh yes; plenty then there is another note in the _morning post_ to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st georges hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days later—that is on wednesday last—there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride
before the what? asked holmes with a start
the vanishing of the lady when did she vanish then?
at the wedding breakfast indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic in fact
yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common
they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon; but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details
i warn you that they are very incomplete
perhaps we may make them less so
such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding:
the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation
the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom) and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride
and is that all? only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one
and it is— that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_ at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands now—so far as it has been set forth in the public press
and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory
lord robert st simon announced our page-boy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face high-nosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frock-coat white waistcoat yellow gloves patent-leather shoes and light-coloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses
good-day lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basket-chair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over
a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society
no i am descending i beg pardon
my last client of the sort was a king
oh really i had no idea and which king?
the king of scandinavia what had he lost his wife?
you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours
of course very right very right im sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion
thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correct—this article for example as to the disappearance of the bride
lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it goes
but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
pray do so when did you first meet miss hatty doran?
in san francisco a year ago
you were travelling in the states?
yes did you become engaged then?
no but you were on a friendly footing?
i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused
her father is very rich? he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope
and how did he make his money?
in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds
now what is your own impression as to the young ladys—your wifes character?
the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuous—volcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bear—he gave a little stately cough—had i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her
have you her photograph? i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon
the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance?
yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her
she brought i understand a considerable dowry?
a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family
and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a _fait accompli_?
i really have made no inquiries on the subject
very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding?
yes was she in good spirits?
never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives
indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding?
she was as bright as possible—at least until after the ceremony
and did you observe any change in her then?
well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
pray let us have it for all that
oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moments delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause
indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then?
oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open
this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends?
no no; i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a common-looking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point
lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on re-entering her fathers house?
i saw her in conversation with her maid
and who is her maid? alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her
a confidential servant? a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way
how long did she speak to this alice?
oh a few minutes i had something else to think of
you did not overhear what they said?
lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant
american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?
she walked into the breakfast-room on your arm?
no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back
but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her brides dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out
quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr dorans house that morning
ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her
lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have been on a friendly footing for some years—i may say on a _very_ friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row
did your wife hear all this?
no thank goodness she did not
and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?
yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her
well it is a possible supposition
you think so too? i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely?
i do not think flora would hurt a fly
still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place?
well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
in short that she had become suddenly deranged?
well really when i consider that she has turned her back—i will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without success—i can hardly explain it in any other fashion
well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?
we could see the other side of the road and the park
quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you
should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising
i have solved it eh? what was that?
i say that i have solved it
where then is my wife? that is a detail which i shall speedily supply
lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately old-fashioned manner he departed
it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross-questioning i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room
my dear holmes i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example
but i have heard all that you have heard
without however the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco-prussian war it is one of these cases—but hullo here is lestrade good-afternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box
the official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him
whats up then? asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look dissatisfied
and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business
really you surprise me who ever heard of such a mixed affair? every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day
and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket
yes i have been dragging the serpentine
in heavens name what for? in search of the body of lady st simon
sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily
have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain? he asked
why? what do you mean? because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other
lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you know all about it he snarled
well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up
oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter?
i think it very unlikely then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it? he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes
oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine?
no they were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off
by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?
at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance
i am afraid that you will find it difficult
are you indeed now? cried lestrade with some bitterness i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar
and how? in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a card-case in the card-case is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this: you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach
very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he
ha you find it so? extremely so i congratulate you warmly
lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked youre looking at the wrong side
on the contrary this is the right side
the right side? youre mad here is the note written in pencil over here
and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply
theres nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade oct 4th rooms 8_s_ breakfast 2_s_ 6_d_ cocktail 1_s_ lunch 2_s_ 6_d_ glass sherry 8_d_ i see nothing in that
very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again
ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories good-day mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door
just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished; i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person
lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away
he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little
it was after five oclock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioners man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a _pâté de foie gras_ pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address
just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands
you seem to expect company they have laid for five
yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs
it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
my messenger reached you then? asked holmes
yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say?
the best possible lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead
what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation?
it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation
ah you look on these things from another standpoint
i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis
it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table
you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position
i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used
i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met
at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist
youre angry robert said she well i guess you have every cause to be
pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly
oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went; but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didnt know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didnt fall down and do a faint right there before the altar
perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter?
if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman weve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man clean-shaven with a sharp face and alert manner
then ill tell our story right away said the lady frank here and i met in 84 in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank; so at last pa wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though; so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you; and i wont claim to be your husband until i come back? well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there; and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa
the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my franks name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank
still if i had married lord st simon of course id have done my duty by him we cant command our love but we can our actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first; but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i didnt drop i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didnt know what to do should i stop the service and make a scene in the church? i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct
when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadnt been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to me—seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding
i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived
then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back so frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to-morrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me
lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
then you wont forgive me? you wont shake hands before i go?
oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him
i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper
i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good-night he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room
then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes
the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard
you were not yourself at fault at all then?
from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be? she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then? if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her? it might be a lover; it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the brides manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—the chances being in favour of the latter
and how in the world did you find them?
it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels
how did you deduce the select?
by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to 226 gordon square; so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment
but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was certainly not very gracious
ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings
xi the adventure of the beryl coronet
holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bow-window looking down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone
my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing-gown looking over my shoulder it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frock-coat shining hat neat brown gaiters and well-cut pearl-grey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
what on earth can be the matter with him? i asked he is looking up at the numbers of the houses
i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands
here? yes; i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you? as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ
you have come to me to tell your story have you not? said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me
the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us
no doubt you think me mad? said he
i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes
god knows i have—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair
pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you
my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder & stevenson of threadneedle street
the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass? we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story
i feel that time is of value said he; that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your co-operation i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can
it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate
yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other than—well perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth—one of the highest noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money
the firm does so when the security is good i answered
it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have £ 50000 at once i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place ones self under obligations
for how long may i ask do you want this sum? i asked
next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once
i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken
i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet?
one of the most precious public possessions of the empire said i
precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft flesh-coloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirty-nine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security
i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
you doubt its value? he asked
not at all i only doubt—
the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient?
ample you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning
seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty £ 1000 notes when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work
when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be? if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room
and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waiting-maid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way
so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmes—a grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best
it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again
and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his finger-tips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a womans quick insight into character
and now there is only she to be described she is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my house—sweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now alas it is too late—forever too late
now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story
when we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room; but i cannot swear that the door was closed mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it
where have you put it? asked arthur
in my own bureau well i hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the night said he
it is locked up i answered
oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard
he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face
look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have £ 200?
no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too generous with you in money matters
you have been very kind said he but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again
and a very good thing too i cried
yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means
i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word
when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure—a duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached
tell me dad said she looking i thought a little disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out to-night?
certainly not she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped
you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it are you sure that everything is fastened?
quite sure dad then good-night i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep
i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear
on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid
i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door
arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you touch that coronet?
the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing
you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen?
stolen he cried yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder
there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he
there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief? did i not see you trying to tear off another piece?
you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world
you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried half-mad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom
you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can
by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property i was determined that the law should have its way in everything
at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes
that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones
you may as well face the matter said i; you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten
keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of £ 1000 my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do
he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words
sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire
do you receive much company? he asked
none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think
do you go out much in society?
arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it
that is unusual in a young girl
she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is four-and-twenty
this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also
terrible she is even more affected than i
you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt?
how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?
yes it was twisted do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it?
god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all? if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so?
precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie? his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep?
they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his bedroom door
a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems?
they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them
have they thought of looking outside the house?
yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined
now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? it appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing-room opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable?
but what other is there? cried the banker with a gesture of despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them?
it is our task to find that out replied holmes; so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details
my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier
fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriage-sweep with a snow-clad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmens entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a womans face her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for self-restraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad? she asked
no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom
but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly
why is he silent then if he is innocent?
who knows? perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him
how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?
oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison
i shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it
this gentleman? she asked facing round to me
no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now
the stable lane? she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to find there? ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime
i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two?
pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up
you heard nothing yourself last night?
nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down
you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows?
yes were they all fastened this morning?
yes you have a maid who has a sweetheart? i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?
yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room and who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet
i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery
but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands?
wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume?
yes; when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom
do you know him? oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper
he stood said holmes to the left of the door—that is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?
yes he did and he is a man with a wooden leg?
something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that? she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager face
i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up
he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last
the bankers dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock
which key was used to open it? he asked
that which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the lumber-room
have you it here? that is it on the dressing-table
sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau
it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the jewellers art and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away
now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off
the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying said he
then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result i feel it give a little said he; but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder? there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?
i do not know what to think it is all dark to me
but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder?
i confess that i still share my uncles perplexity
your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?
he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt
thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside
he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever
i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he; i can serve you best by returning to my rooms
but the gems mr holmes where are they?
i cannot tell the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he cried and my son? you give me hopes?
my opinion is in no way altered
then for gods sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night?
if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to-morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw
i would give my fortune to have them back
very good i shall look into the matter between this and then good-bye; it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening
it was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class
i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it wont do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a will-o-the-wisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition
i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea
i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on
where to? oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back dont wait up for me in case i should be late
how are you getting on? oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self
i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt
i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible
you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning
why it is after nine now i answered i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring
it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him
i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me
deserted you? yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers in this note:
my dearest uncle—i feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for; and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me in life or in death i am ever your loving
mary what could she mean by that note mr holmes? do you think it points to suicide?
no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles
ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes; you have learned something where are the gems?
you would not think £ 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?
i would pay ten that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your cheque-book? here is a pen better make it out for £ 4000
with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table
with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved
the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly
owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it
no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one
then it was not arthur who took them?
i told you yesterday and i repeat to-day that it was not
you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known
he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips
for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery
i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together
my mary? impossible it is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in england—a ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening
i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face
i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her wooden-legged lover which was all perfectly true
your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain
as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how all-important it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene
is it possible? gasped the banker
you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret
and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him
when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmens path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while wooden-leg had waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police; but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me
there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue
on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet?
it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty
and who could it be who was her confederate? a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you? i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family
well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir georges house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks
i saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder
precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held—£ 1000 apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at £ 1000 apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after what i may call a really hard days work
a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now
i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment
xii the adventure of the copper beeches
to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of _the daily telegraph_ it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province
and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records
you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing
it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friends singular character
no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales
it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial
the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest
pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zero-point i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me
it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus:
dear mr holmes—i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess i shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if i do not inconvenience you yours faithfully
violet hunter do you know the young lady? i asked
not i it is half-past ten now
yes and i have no doubt that is her ring
it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also
well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question
as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plovers egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world
you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do
pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you
i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together to listen to her story
i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wits end as to what i should do
there is a well-known agency for governesses in the west end called westaways and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them
well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper
that will do said he; i could not ask for anything better capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him
you are looking for a situation miss? he asked
yes sir as governess? yes sir
and what salary do you ask?
i had £ 4 a month in my last place with colonel spence munro
oh tut tut sweating—rank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments?
my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i a little french a little german music and drawing—
tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? your salary with me madam would commence at £ 100 a year
you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocket-book and took out a note
it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe
it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself
may i ask where you live sir? said i
hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old country-house
and my duties sir? i should be glad to know what they would be
one child—one dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again
i was a little startled at the nature of the childs amusement but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking
my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single child?
no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh?
i should be happy to make myself useful
quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you know—faddy but kind-hearted if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh?
no said i considerably astonished at his words
or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you?
oh no or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?
i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke
i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your hair?
no sir i really could not i answered firmly
ah very well; then that quite settles the matter it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies
the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal
do you desire your name to be kept upon the books? she asked
if you please miss stoper well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you good-day to you miss hunter she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page
well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few governesses in england are getting £ 100 a year besides what use was my hair to me? many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it here and i will read it to you:
the copper beeches near winchester dear miss hunter—miss stoper has very kindly given me your address and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we are willing to give £ 30 a quarter or £ 120 a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice (now in philadelphia) which would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall meet you with the dog-cart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully
jephro rucastle that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling
but you would not advise me to refuse?
i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for
what is the meaning of it all mr holmes?
ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?
well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind good-natured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?
that is a possible solution—in fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady
but the money mr holmes the money
well yes of course the pay is good—too good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you £ 120 a year when they could have their pick for £ 40? there must be some strong reason behind
i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me
oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—
danger what danger do you foresee?
holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help
that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair to-night and start for winchester to-morrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her way
at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself
and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past
it was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried impatiently i cant make bricks without clay and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation
the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me
just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies
the summons was a brief and urgent one
please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday to-morrow it said do come i am at my wits end
hunter will you come with me? asked holmes glancing up
i should wish to just look it up then
there is a train at half-past nine said i glancing over my bradshaw it is due at winchester at 11:30
that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning
by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a mans energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage
are they not fresh and beautiful? i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street
but holmes shook his head gravely
do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there
good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads?
they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside
you horrify me but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened
no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away
quite so she has her freedom
what _can_ be the matter then? can you suggest no explanation?
i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell
the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sitting-room and our lunch awaited us upon the table
i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it is so very kind of you both; but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
pray tell us what has happened to you
i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose
let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen
in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual ill-treatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them
what can you not understand? their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the copper beeches it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southertons preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is not mad i found her to be a silent pale-faced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than forty-five from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her fathers young wife
mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story
i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not
i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building
for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet; on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged
the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawing-room which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery
two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense _répertoire_ and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellow-backed novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress
you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means my hand-mirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once
jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter
no friend of yours miss hunter? he asked
no i know no one in these parts
dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away
surely it would be better to take no notice
no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that
i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road
pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one
you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about
look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks is he not a beauty?
i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given its only carlo my mastiff i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life is worth
the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done
and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair
i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer? with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary? puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked
i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look
this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever
ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with business matters
i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up
he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark
photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it? who would have ever believed it? he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest
well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of womans instinct; perhaps it was womans instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door
it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through
there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside
so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open
oh i am so frightened i panted
my dear young lady my dear young lady—you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was—and what has frightened you my dear young lady?
but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him
i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there
only that? said he looking at me keenly
why what did you think? i asked
why do you think that i lock this door?
i am sure that i do not know
it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see? he was still smiling in the most amiable manner
i am sure if i had known—
well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again—here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—ill throw you to the mastiff
i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three oclock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do
holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
is toller still drunk? he asked
yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him
that is well and the rucastles go out to-night?
yes is there a cellar with a good strong lock?
yes the wine-cellar you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat? i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman
i will try what is it?
we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely
i will do it excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt as you wore the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child
what on earth has that to do with it? i ejaculated
my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this childs disposition is abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power
i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature
we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery
we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside public-house the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step
have you managed it? asked holmes
a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastles
you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business
we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over
i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in
it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone
there has been some villainy here said holmes; this beauty has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim off
but how? through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it
but it is impossible said miss hunter; the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away
he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready
the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him
you villain said he wheres your daughter?
the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight
it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i? you are in my power ill serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go
hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter
i have my revolver said i
better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
my god he cried someone has loosed the dog its not been fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late
holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawing-room sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room
mrs toller cried miss hunter yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didnt let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted
ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else
yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know
then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark
i will soon make it clear to you said she; and id have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if theres police-court business over this youll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alices friend too
she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friends house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever and for six weeks was at deaths door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didnt make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be
ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment?
yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler
that was it sir but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his
mr fowler was a very kind-spoken free-handed gentleman said mrs toller serenely
and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out
you have it sir just as it happened
i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our _locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one
and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success

chapter i in which phileas fogg and passepartout accept each other the one as master the other as man
mr phileas fogg lived in 1872 at no 7 saville row burlington gardens the house in which sheridan died in 1814 he was one of the most noticeable members of the reform club though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage about whom little was known except that he was a polished man of the world people said that he resembled byron--at least that his head was byronic; but he was a bearded tranquil byron who might live on a thousand years without growing old
certainly an englishman it was more doubtful whether phileas fogg was a londoner he was never seen on change nor at the bank nor in the counting-rooms of the city; no ships ever came into london docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the inns of court either at the temple or lincolns inn or grays inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the court of chancery or in the exchequer or the queens bench or the ecclesiastical courts he certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer his name was strange to the scientific and learned societies and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the royal institution or the london institution the artisans association or the institution of arts and sciences he belonged in fact to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the english capital from the harmonic to that of the entomologists founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects
phileas fogg was a member of the reform and that was all
the way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough
he was recommended by the barings with whom he had an open credit his cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current which was always flush
was phileas fogg rich? undoubtedly but those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune and mr fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information he was not lavish nor on the contrary avaricious; for whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble useful or benevolent purpose he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously he was in short the least communicative of men he talked very little and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner his daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled
had he travelled? it was likely for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it he often corrected with a few clear words the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers pointing out the true probabilities and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight so often did events justify his predictions he must have travelled everywhere at least in the spirit
it was at least certain that phileas fogg had not absented himself from london for many years those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else his sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist he often won at this game which as a silent one harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse being reserved as a fund for his charities mr fogg played not to win but for the sake of playing the game was in his eyes a contest a struggle with a difficulty yet a motionless unwearying struggle congenial to his tastes
phileas fogg was not known to have either wife or children which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends which is certainly more unusual he lived alone in his house in saville row whither none penetrated a single domestic sufficed to serve him he breakfasted and dined at the club at hours mathematically fixed in the same room at the same table never taking his meals with other members much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight only to retire at once to bed he never used the cosy chambers which the reform provides for its favoured members he passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in saville row either in sleeping or making his toilet when he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry ionic columns and illumined by blue painted windows when he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its kitchens and pantries its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters in dress coats and shoes with swan-skin soles who proffered the viands in special porcelain and on the finest linen; club decanters of a lost mould contained his sherry his port and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice brought at great cost from the american lakes
if to live in this style is to be eccentric it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity
the mansion in saville row though not sumptuous was exceedingly comfortable the habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic but phileas fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular on this very 2nd of october he had dismissed james forster because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor who was due at the house between eleven and half-past
phileas fogg was seated squarely in his armchair his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade his hands resting on his knees his body straight his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours the minutes the seconds the days the months and the years at exactly half-past eleven mr fogg would according to his daily habit quit saville row and repair to the reform
a rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where phileas fogg was seated and james forster the dismissed servant appeared
the new servant said he a young man of thirty advanced and bowed
you are a frenchman i believe asked phileas fogg and your name is john?
jean if monsieur pleases replied the newcomer jean passepartout a surname which has clung to me because i have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another i believe im honest monsieur but to be outspoken ive had several trades ive been an itinerant singer a circus-rider when i used to vault like leotard and dance on a rope like blondin then i got to be a professor of gymnastics so as to make better use of my talents; and then i was a sergeant fireman at paris and assisted at many a big fire but i quitted france five years ago and wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life took service as a valet here in england finding myself out of place and hearing that monsieur phileas fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the united kingdom i have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life and forgetting even the name of passepartout
passepartout suits me responded mr fogg you are well recommended to me; i hear a good report of you you know my conditions?
yes monsieur good what time is it?
twenty-two minutes after eleven returned passepartout drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket
you are too slow said mr fogg
pardon me monsieur it is impossible--
you are four minutes too slow no matter; its enough to mention the error now from this moment twenty-nine minutes after eleven am this wednesday 2nd october you are in my service
phileas fogg got up took his hat in his left hand put it on his head with an automatic motion and went off without a word
passepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master going out he heard it shut again; it was his predecessor james forster departing in his turn passepartout remained alone in the house in saville row
chapter ii in which passepartout is convinced that he has at last found his ideal
faith muttered passepartout somewhat flurried ive seen people at madame tussauds as lively as my new master
madame tussauds people let it be said are of wax and are much visited in london; speech is all that is wanting to make them human
during his brief interview with mr fogg passepartout had been carefully observing him he appeared to be a man about forty years of age with fine handsome features and a tall well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light his forehead compact and unwrinkled his face rather pale his teeth magnificent his countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call repose in action a quality of those who act rather than talk calm and phlegmatic with a clear eye mr fogg seemed a perfect type of that english composure which angelica kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas seen in the various phases of his daily life he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced as exactly regulated as a leroy chronometer phileas fogg was indeed exactitude personified and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men as well as in animals the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions
he was so exact that he was never in a hurry was always ready and was economical alike of his steps and his motions he never took one step too many and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures and was never seen to be moved or agitated he was the most deliberate person in the world yet always reached his destination at the exact moment
he lived alone and so to speak outside of every social relation; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction and that friction retards he never rubbed against anybody
as for passepartout he was a true parisian of paris since he had abandoned his own country for england taking service as a valet he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow with a pleasant face lips a trifle protruding soft-mannered and serviceable with a good round head such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend his eyes were blue his complexion rubicund his figure almost portly and well-built his body muscular and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days his brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging minervas tresses passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet
it would be rash to predict how passepartouts lively nature would agree with mr fogg it was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it though he had already served in ten english houses but he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular constantly running about the country or on the look-out for adventure his last master young lord longferry member of parliament after passing his nights in the haymarket taverns was too often brought home in the morning on policemens shoulders passepartout desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which being ill-received he took his leave hearing that mr phileas fogg was looking for a servant and that his life was one of unbroken regularity that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight he felt sure that this would be the place he was after he presented himself and was accepted as has been seen
at half-past eleven then passepartout found himself alone in the house in saville row he began its inspection without delay scouring it from cellar to garret so clean well-arranged solemn a mansion pleased him; it seemed to him like a snails shell lighted and warmed by gas which sufficed for both these purposes when passepartout reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to inhabit and he was well satisfied with it electric bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on the mantel stood an electric clock precisely like that in mr foggs bedchamber both beating the same second at the same instant thats good thatll do said passepartout to himself
he suddenly observed hung over the clock a card which upon inspection proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house it comprised all that was required of the servant from eight in the morning exactly at which hour phileas fogg rose till half-past eleven when he left the house for the reform club--all the details of service the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven am till midnight the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired
mr foggs wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste each pair of trousers coat and vest bore a number indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the masters shoes in short the house in saville row which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated sheridan was cosiness comfort and method idealised there was no study nor were there books which would have been quite useless to mr fogg; for at the reform two libraries one of general literature and the other of law and politics were at his service a moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits
having scrutinised the house from top to bottom he rubbed his hands a broad smile overspread his features and he said joyfully this is just what i wanted ah we shall get on together mr fogg and i what a domestic and regular gentleman a real machine; well i dont mind serving a machine
chapter iii in which a conversation takes place which seems likely to cost phileas fogg dear
phileas fogg having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times reached the reform club an imposing edifice in pall mall which could not have cost less than three millions he repaired at once to the dining-room the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring; and took his place at the habitual table the cover of which had already been laid for him his breakfast consisted of a side-dish a broiled fish with reading sauce a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms a rhubarb and gooseberry tart and a morsel of cheshire cheese the whole being washed down with several cups of tea for which the reform is famous he rose at thirteen minutes to one and directed his steps towards the large hall a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings a flunkey handed him an uncut times which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation the perusal of this paper absorbed phileas fogg until a quarter before four whilst the standard his next task occupied him till the dinner hour dinner passed as breakfast had done and mr fogg re-appeared in the reading-room and sat down to the pall mall at twenty minutes before six half an hour later several members of the reform came in and drew up to the fireplace where a coal fire was steadily burning they were mr foggs usual partners at whist: andrew stuart an engineer; john sullivan and samuel fallentin bankers; thomas flanagan a brewer; and gauthier ralph one of the directors of the bank of england--all rich and highly respectable personages even in a club which comprises the princes of english trade and finance
well ralph said thomas flanagan what about that robbery?
oh replied stuart the bank will lose the money
on the contrary broke in ralph i hope we may put our hands on the robber skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of america and the continent and hell be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers
but have you got the robbers description? asked stuart
in the first place he is no robber at all returned ralph positively
what a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds no robber?
no perhaps hes a manufacturer then
the daily telegraph says that he is a gentleman
it was phileas fogg whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers who made this remark he bowed to his friends and entered into the conversation the affair which formed its subject and which was town talk had occurred three days before at the bank of england a package of banknotes to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds had been taken from the principal cashiers table that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence of course he could not have his eyes everywhere let it be observed that the bank of england reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public there are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold silver banknotes are freely exposed at the mercy of the first comer a keen observer of english customs relates that being in one of the rooms of the bank one day he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds he took it up scrutinised it passed it to his neighbour he to the next man and so on until the ingot going from hand to hand was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour meanwhile the cashier had not so much as raised his head but in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly the package of notes not being found when five oclock sounded from the ponderous clock in the drawing office the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss as soon as the robbery was discovered picked detectives hastened off to liverpool glasgow havre suez brindisi new york and other ports inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds and five per cent on the sum that might be recovered detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left london by rail and a judicial examination was at once entered upon
there were real grounds for supposing as the daily telegraph said that the thief did not belong to a professional band on the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners and with a well-to-do air had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed a description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits of whom ralph was one did not despair of his apprehension the papers and clubs were full of the affair and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the reform club was especially agitated several of its members being bank officials
ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity but stuart was far from sharing this confidence; and as they placed themselves at the whist-table they continued to argue the matter stuart and flanagan played together while phileas fogg had fallentin for his partner as the game proceeded the conversation ceased excepting between the rubbers when it revived again
i maintain said stuart that the chances are in favour of the thief who must be a shrewd fellow
well but where can he fly to? asked ralph no country is safe for him
pshaw where could he go then?
oh i dont know that the world is big enough
it was once said phileas fogg in a low tone cut sir he added handing the cards to thomas flanagan
the discussion fell during the rubber after which stuart took up its thread
what do you mean by `once? has the world grown smaller?
certainly returned ralph i agree with mr fogg the world has grown smaller since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago and that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed
and also why the thief can get away more easily
be so good as to play mr stuart said phileas fogg
but the incredulous stuart was not convinced and when the hand was finished said eagerly: you have a strange way ralph of proving that the world has grown smaller so because you can go round it in three months--
in eighty days interrupted phileas fogg
that is true gentlemen added john sullivan only eighty days now that the section between rothal and allahabad on the great indian peninsula railway has been opened here is the estimate made by the daily telegraph:
from london to suez via mont cenis and brindisi by rail and steamboats  7 days from suez to bombay by steamer  13  from bombay to calcutta by rail  3  from calcutta to hong kong by steamer  13  from hong kong to yokohama (japan) by steamer  6  from yokohama to san francisco by steamer  22  from san francisco to new york by rail  7  from new york to london by steamer and rail  9  ------ total  80 days
yes in eighty days exclaimed stuart who in his excitement made a false deal but that doesnt take into account bad weather contrary winds shipwrecks railway accidents and so on
all included returned phileas fogg continuing to play despite the discussion
but suppose the hindoos or indians pull up the rails replied stuart; suppose they stop the trains pillage the luggage-vans and scalp the passengers
all included calmly retorted fogg; adding as he threw down the cards two trumps
stuart whose turn it was to deal gathered them up and went on: you are right theoretically mr fogg but practically--
practically also mr stuart id like to see you do it in eighty days
it depends on you shall we go?
heaven preserve me but i would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey made under these conditions is impossible
quite possible on the contrary returned mr fogg
well make it then the journey round the world in eighty days?
yes i should like nothing better
when? at once only i warn you that i shall do it at your expense
its absurd cried stuart who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend come lets go on with the game
deal over again then said phileas fogg theres a false deal
stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them down again
well mr fogg said he it shall be so: i will wager the four thousand on it
calm yourself my dear stuart said fallentin its only a joke
when i say ill wager returned stuart i mean it
all right said mr fogg; and turning to the others he continued: i have a deposit of twenty thousand at barings which i will willingly risk upon it
twenty thousand pounds cried sullivan twenty thousand pounds which you would lose by a single accidental delay
the unforeseen does not exist quietly replied phileas fogg
but mr fogg eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made
a well-used minimum suffices for everything
but in order not to exceed it you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers and from the steamers upon the trains again
i will jump--mathematically you are joking
a true englishman doesnt joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager replied phileas fogg solemnly i will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that i will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes do you accept?
we accept replied messrs stuart fallentin sullivan flanagan and ralph after consulting each other
good said mr fogg the train leaves for dover at a quarter before nine i will take it
this very evening? asked stuart this very evening returned phileas fogg he took out and consulted a pocket almanac and added as today is wednesday the 2nd of october i shall be due in london in this very room of the reform club on saturday the 21st of december at a quarter before nine pm; or else the twenty thousand pounds now deposited in my name at barings will belong to you in fact and in right gentlemen here is a cheque for the amount
a memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties during which phileas fogg preserved a stoical composure he certainly did not bet to win and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds half of his fortune because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult not to say unattainable project as for his antagonists they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their stake as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend
the clock struck seven and the party offered to suspend the game so that mr fogg might make his preparations for departure
i am quite ready now was his tranquil response diamonds are trumps: be so good as to play gentlemen
chapter iv in which phileas fogg astounds passepartout his servant
having won twenty guineas at whist and taken leave of his friends phileas fogg at twenty-five minutes past seven left the reform club
passepartout who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour; for according to rule he was not due in saville row until precisely midnight
mr fogg repaired to his bedroom and called out passepartout
passepartout did not reply it could not be he who was called; it was not the right hour
passepartout repeated mr fogg without raising his voice
passepartout made his appearance ive called you twice observed his master
but it is not midnight responded the other showing his watch
i know it; i dont blame you we start for dover and calais in ten minutes
a puzzled grin overspread passepartouts round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master
monsieur is going to leave home?
yes returned phileas fogg we are going round the world
passepartout opened wide his eyes raised his eyebrows held up his hands and seemed about to collapse so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment
round the world he murmured in eighty days responded mr fogg so we havent a moment to lose
but the trunks? gasped passepartout unconsciously swaying his head from right to left
well have no trunks; only a carpet-bag with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me and the same for you well buy our clothes on the way bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak and some stout shoes though we shall do little walking make haste
passepartout tried to reply but could not he went out mounted to his own room fell into a chair and muttered: thats good that is and i who wanted to remain quiet
he mechanically set about making the preparations for departure around the world in eighty days was his master a fool? no was this a joke then? they were going to dover; good to calais; good again after all passepartout who had been away from france five years would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again perhaps they would go as far as paris and it would do his eyes good to see paris once more but surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt--but then it was none the less true that he was going away this so domestic person hitherto
by eight oclock passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then still troubled in mind he carefully shut the door of his room and descended to mr fogg
mr fogg was quite ready under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of bradshaws continental railway steam transit and general guide with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways he took the carpet-bag opened it and slipped into it a goodly roll of bank of england notes which would pass wherever he might go
you have forgotten nothing? asked he
nothing monsieur my mackintosh and cloak?
here they are good take this carpet-bag handing it to passepartout take good care of it for there are twenty thousand pounds in it
passepartout nearly dropped the bag as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold and weighed him down
master and man then descended the street-door was double-locked and at the end of saville row they took a cab and drove rapidly to charing cross the cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master who after paying the cabman was about to enter the station when a poor beggar-woman with a child in her arms her naked feet smeared with mud her head covered with a wretched bonnet from which hung a tattered feather and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl approached and mournfully asked for alms
mr fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist and handed them to the beggar saying here my good woman im glad that i met you; and passed on
passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his masters action touched his susceptible heart
two first-class tickets for paris having been speedily purchased mr fogg was crossing the station to the train when he perceived his five friends of the reform
well gentlemen said he im off you see; and if you will examine my passport when i get back you will be able to judge whether i have accomplished the journey agreed upon
oh that would be quite unnecessary mr fogg said ralph politely we will trust your word as a gentleman of honour
you do not forget when you are due in london again? asked stuart
in eighty days; on saturday the 21st of december 1872 at a quarter before nine pm good-bye gentlemen
phileas fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle screamed and the train slowly glided out of the station
the night was dark and a fine steady rain was falling phileas fogg snugly ensconced in his corner did not open his lips passepartout not yet recovered from his stupefaction clung mechanically to the carpet-bag with its enormous treasure
just as the train was whirling through sydenham passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair
whats the matter? asked mr fogg
alas in my hurry--i--i forgot-- what?
to turn off the gas in my room
very well young man returned mr fogg coolly; it will burn--at your expense
chapter v in which a new species of funds unknown to the moneyed men appears on change
phileas fogg rightly suspected that his departure from london would create a lively sensation at the west end the news of the bet spread through the reform club and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members from the club it soon got into the papers throughout england the boasted tour of the world was talked about disputed argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another alabama claim some took sides with phileas fogg but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd impossible they declared that the tour of the world could be made except theoretically and on paper in this minimum of time and with the existing means of travelling the times standard morning post and daily news and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted mr foggs project as madness; the daily telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him people in general thought him a lunatic and blamed his reform club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer
articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question for geography is one of the pet subjects of the english; and the columns devoted to phileas foggs venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers at first some rash individuals principally of the gentler sex espoused his cause which became still more popular when the illustrated london news came out with his portrait copied from a photograph in the reform club a few readers of the daily telegraph even dared to say why not after all? stranger things have come to pass
at last a long article appeared on the 7th of october in the bulletin of the royal geographical society which treated the question from every point of view and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise
everything it said was against the travellers every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature a miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival which was impossible was absolutely necessary to his success he might perhaps reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours in europe where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing india in three days and the united states in seven could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task? there were accidents to machinery the liability of trains to run off the line collisions bad weather the blocking up by snow--were not all these against phileas fogg? would he not find himself when travelling by steamer in winter at the mercy of the winds and fogs? is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time? but a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication; should phileas fogg once miss even by an hour; a steamer he would have to wait for the next and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain
this article made a great deal of noise and being copied into all the papers seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist
everybody knows that england is the world of betting men who are of a higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the english temperament not only the members of the reform but the general public made heavy wagers for or against phileas fogg who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse bonds were issued and made their appearance on change; phileas fogg bonds were offered at par or at a premium and a great business was done in them but five days after the article in the bulletin of the geographical society appeared the demand began to subside: phileas fogg declined they were offered by packages at first of five then of ten until at last nobody would take less than twenty fifty a hundred
lord albemarle an elderly paralytic gentleman was now the only advocate of phileas fogg left this noble lord who was fastened to his chair would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on phileas fogg when the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him he contented himself with replying if the thing is feasible the first to do it ought to be an englishman
the fogg party dwindled more and more everybody was going against him and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price
the commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine oclock one evening when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands:
suez to london rowan commissioner of police scotland yard:
ive found the bank robber phileas fogg send with out delay warrant of arrest to bombay
fix detective the effect of this dispatch was instantaneous the polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber his photograph which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the reform club was minutely examined and it betrayed feature by feature the description of the robber which had been provided to the police the mysterious habits of phileas fogg were recalled; his solitary ways his sudden departure; and it seemed clear that in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives and throw them off his track
chapter vi in which fix the detective betrays a very natural impatience
the circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about phileas fogg was sent were as follows:
the steamer mongolia belonging to the peninsular and oriental company built of iron of two thousand eight hundred tons burden and five hundred horse-power was due at eleven oclock am on wednesday the 9th of october at suez the mongolia plied regularly between brindisi and bombay via the suez canal and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company always making more than ten knots an hour between brindisi and suez and nine and a half between suez and bombay
two men were promenading up and down the wharves among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village--now thanks to the enterprise of m lesseps a fast-growing town one was the british consul at suez who despite the prophecies of the english government and the unfavourable predictions of stephenson was in the habit of seeing from his office window english ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal by which the old roundabout route from england to india by the cape of good hope was abridged by at least a half the other was a small slight-built personage with a nervous intelligent face and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching he was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience nervously pacing up and down and unable to stand still for a moment this was fix one of the detectives who had been dispatched from england in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at suez and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at london the detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success and awaited with a feverish impatience easy to understand the arrival of the steamer mongolia
so you say consul asked he for the twentieth time that this steamer is never behind time?
no mr fix replied the consul she was bespoken yesterday at port said and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft i repeat that the mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the companys regulations and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed
does she come directly from brindisi?
directly from brindisi; she takes on the indian mails there and she left there saturday at five pm have patience mr fix; she will not be late but really i dont see how from the description you have you will be able to recognise your man even if he is on board the mongolia
a man rather feels the presence of these fellows consul than recognises them you must have a scent for them and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing seeing and smelling ive arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time and if my thief is on board ill answer for it; hell not slip through my fingers
i hope so mr fix for it was a heavy robbery
a magnificent robbery consul; fifty-five thousand pounds we dont often have such windfalls burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays a fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings
mr fix said the consul i like your way of talking and hope youll succeed; but i fear you will find it far from easy dont you see the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man?
consul remarked the detective dogmatically great robbers always resemble honest folks fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand the artistic thing is to unmask honest countenances; its no light task i admit but a real art
mr fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit
little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; sailors of various nations merchants ship-brokers porters fellahs bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected the weather was clear and slightly chilly the minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun a jetty pier some two thousand yards along extended into the roadstead a number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys were discernible on the red sea
as he passed among the busy crowd fix according to habit scrutinised the passers-by with a keen rapid glance
it was now half-past ten the steamer doesnt come he exclaimed as the port clock struck
she cant be far off now returned his companion
how long will she stop at suez?
four hours; long enough to get in her coal it is thirteen hundred and ten miles from suez to aden at the other end of the red sea and she has to take in a fresh coal supply
and does she go from suez directly to bombay?
without putting in anywhere good said fix if the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at suez so as to reach the dutch or french colonies in asia by some other route he ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in india which is english soil
unless objected the consul he is exceptionally shrewd an english criminal you know is always better concealed in london than anywhere else
this observation furnished the detective food for thought and meanwhile the consul went away to his office fix left alone was more impatient than ever having a presentiment that the robber was on board the mongolia if he had indeed left london intending to reach the new world he would naturally take the route via india which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the atlantic but fixs reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles which announced the arrival of the mongolia the porters and fellahs rushed down the quay and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks and eleven oclock struck as she anchored in the road she brought an unusual number of passengers some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town while the greater part disembarked in the boats and landed on the quay
fix took up a position and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance presently one of the passengers after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the english consulate at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed fix instinctively took the passport and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer an involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from scotland yard
is this your passport? asked he
no its my masters and your master is--
he stayed on board but he must go to the consuls in person so as to establish his identity
oh is that necessary? quite indispensable
and where is the consulate? there on the corner of the square said fix pointing to a house two hundred steps off
ill go and fetch my master who wont be much pleased however to be disturbed
the passenger bowed to fix and returned to the steamer
chapter vii which once more demonstrates the uselessness of passports as aids to detectives
the detective passed down the quay and rapidly made his way to the consuls office where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official
consul said he without preamble i have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the mongolia and he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport
well mr fix replied the consul i shall not be sorry to see the rascals face; but perhaps he wont come here--that is if he is the person you suppose him to be a robber doesnt quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him; and besides he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned
if he is as shrewd as i think he is consul he will come
to have his passport visaed? yes passports are only good for annoying honest folks and aiding in the flight of rogues i assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do; but i hope you will not visa the passport
why not? if the passport is genuine i have no right to refuse
still i must keep this man here until i can get a warrant to arrest him from london
ah thats your look-out but i cannot--
the consul did not finish his sentence for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door and two strangers entered one of whom was the servant whom fix had met on the quay the other who was his master held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it the consul took the document and carefully read it whilst fix observed or rather devoured the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room
you are mr phileas fogg? said the consul after reading the passport
i am and this man is your servant?
he is: a frenchman named passepartout
you are from london? yes and you are going--
to bombay very good sir you know that a visa is useless and that no passport is required?
i know it sir replied phileas fogg; but i wish to prove by your visa that i came by suez
very well sir the consul proceeded to sign and date the passport after which he added his official seal mr fogg paid the customary fee coldly bowed and went out followed by his servant
well? queried the detective well he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man replied the consul
possibly; but that is not the question do you think consul that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles feature by feature the robber whose description i have received?
i concede that; but then you know all descriptions--
ill make certain of it interrupted fix the servant seems to me less mysterious than the master; besides hes a frenchman and cant help talking excuse me for a little while consul
fix started off in search of passepartout
meanwhile mr fogg after leaving the consulate repaired to the quay gave some orders to passepartout went off to the mongolia in a boat and descended to his cabin he took up his note-book which contained the following memoranda:
left london wednesday october 2nd at 845 pm reached paris thursday october 3rd at 720 am left paris thursday at 840 am reached turin by mont cenis friday october 4th at 635 am left turin friday at 720 am arrived at brindisi saturday october 5th at 4 pm sailed on the mongolia saturday at 5 pm reached suez wednesday october 9th at 11 am total of hours spent 158+; or in days six days and a half
these dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns indicating the month the day of the month and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point paris brindisi suez bombay calcutta singapore hong kong yokohama san francisco new york and london--from the 2nd of october to the 21st of december; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality this methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed and mr fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time on this friday october 9th he noted his arrival at suez and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost he sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin never once thinking of inspecting the town being one of those englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics
chapter viii in which passepartout talks rather more perhaps than is prudent
fix soon rejoined passepartout who was lounging and looking about on the quay as if he did not feel that he at least was obliged not to see anything
well my friend said the detective coming up with him is your passport visaed?
ah its you is it monsieur? responded passepartout thanks yes the passport is all right
and you are looking about you?
yes; but we travel so fast that i seem to be journeying in a dream so this is suez?
yes in egypt? certainly in egypt
and in africa? in africa in africa repeated passepartout just think monsieur i had no idea that we should go farther than paris; and all that i saw of paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning between the northern and the lyons stations through the windows of a car and in a driving rain how i regret not having seen once more pere la chaise and the circus in the champs elysees
you are in a great hurry then?
i am not but my master is by the way i must buy some shoes and shirts we came away without trunks only with a carpet-bag
i will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want
really monsieur you are very kind
and they walked off together passepartout chatting volubly as they went along
above all said he; dont let me lose the steamer
you have plenty of time; its only twelve oclock
passepartout pulled out his big watch twelve he exclaimed; why its only eight minutes before ten
your watch is slow my watch? a family watch monsieur which has come down from my great-grandfather it doesnt vary five minutes in the year its a perfect chronometer look you
i see how it is said fix you have kept london time which is two hours behind that of suez you ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country
i regulate my watch? never well then it will not agree with the sun
so much the worse for the sun monsieur the sun will be wrong then
and the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture after a few minutes silence fix resumed: you left london hastily then?
i rather think so last friday at eight oclock in the evening monsieur fogg came home from his club and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off
but where is your master going?
always straight ahead he is going round the world
round the world? cried fix yes and in eighty days he says it is on a wager; but between us i dont believe a word of it that wouldnt be common sense theres something else in the wind
ah mr fogg is a character is he?
i should say he was is he rich?
no doubt for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him and he doesnt spare the money on the way either: he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the mongolia if he gets us to bombay well in advance of time
and you have known your master a long time?
why no; i entered his service the very day we left london
the effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined the hasty departure from london soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by mr fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet--all confirmed fix in his theory he continued to pump poor passepartout and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master who lived a solitary existence in london was said to be rich though no one knew whence came his riches and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits fix felt sure that phileas fogg would not land at suez but was really going on to bombay
is bombay far from here? asked passepartout
pretty far it is a ten days voyage by sea
and in what country is bombay?
india in asia? certainly the deuce i was going to tell you theres one thing that worries me--my burner
what burner? my gas-burner which i forgot to turn off and which is at this moment burning at my expense i have calculated monsieur that i lose two shillings every four and twenty hours exactly sixpence more than i earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey--
did fix pay any attention to passepartouts trouble about the gas? it is not probable he was not listening but was cogitating a project passepartout and he had now reached the shop where fix left his companion to make his purchases after recommending him not to miss the steamer and hurried back to the consulate now that he was fully convinced fix had quite recovered his equanimity
consul said he i have no longer any doubt i have spotted my man he passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days
then hes a sharp fellow returned the consul and counts on returning to london after putting the police of the two countries off his track
well see about that replied fix
but are you not mistaken? i am not mistaken
why was this robber so anxious to prove by the visa that he had passed through suez?
why? i have no idea; but listen to me
he reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with passepartout
in short said the consul appearances are wholly against this man and what are you going to do?
send a dispatch to london for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to bombay take passage on board the mongolia follow my rogue to india and there on english ground arrest him politely with my warrant in my hand and my hand on his shoulder
having uttered these words with a cool careless air the detective took leave of the consul and repaired to the telegraph office whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the london police office a quarter of an hour later found fix with a small bag in his hand proceeding on board the mongolia; and ere many moments longer the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the red sea
chapter ix in which the red sea and the indian ocean prove propitious to the designs of phileas fogg
the distance between suez and aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it the mongolia thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer seemed likely so rapid was her speed to reach her destination considerably within that time the greater part of the passengers from brindisi were bound for india some for bombay others for calcutta by way of bombay the nearest route thither now that a railway crosses the indian peninsula among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades the latter being either attached to the regular british forces or commanding the sepoy troops and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the east india company: for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds brigadiers 2400 pounds and generals of divisions 4000 pounds what with the military men a number of rich young englishmen on their travels and the hospitable efforts of the purser the time passed quickly on the mongolia the best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast lunch dinner and the eight oclock supper and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away when the sea was tranquil with music dancing and games
but the red sea is full of caprice and often boisterous like most long and narrow gulfs when the wind came from the african or asian coast the mongolia with her long hull rolled fearfully then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased yet the good ship ploughed straight on unretarded by wind or wave towards the straits of bab-el-mandeb what was phileas fogg doing all this time? it might be thought that in his anxiety he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind the disorderly raging of the billows--every chance in short which might force the mongolia to slacken her speed and thus interrupt his journey but if he thought of these possibilities he did not betray the fact by any outward sign
always the same impassible member of the reform club whom no incident could surprise as unvarying as the ships chronometers and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck he passed through the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifference; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which along its borders raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf which the old historians always spoke of with horror and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices how did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia? he made his four hearty meals every day regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself a tax-collector on the way to his post at goa; the rev decimus smith returning to his parish at bombay; and a brigadier-general of the english army who was about to rejoin his brigade at benares made up the party and with mr fogg played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence
as for passepartout he too had escaped sea-sickness and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin he rather enjoyed the voyage for he was well fed and well lodged took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing and consoled himself with the delusion that his masters whim would end at bombay he was pleased on the day after leaving suez to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays
if i am not mistaken said he approaching this person with his most amiable smile you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at suez?
ah i quite recognise you you are the servant of the strange englishman--
just so monsieur-- fix monsieur fix resumed passepartout im charmed to find you on board where are you bound?
like you to bombay thats capital have you made this trip before?
several times i am one of the agents of the peninsular company
then you know india? why yes replied fix who spoke cautiously
a curious place this india? oh very curious mosques minarets temples fakirs pagodas tigers snakes elephants i hope you will have ample time to see the sights
i hope so monsieur fix you see a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train and from a railway train upon a steamer again pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days no; all these gymnastics you may be sure will cease at bombay
and mr fogg is getting on well? asked fix in the most natural tone in the world
quite well and i too i eat like a famished ogre; its the sea air
but i never see your master on deck
never; he hasnt the least curiosity
do you know mr passepartout that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand--perhaps a diplomatic mission?
faith monsieur fix i assure you i know nothing about it nor would i give half a crown to find out
after this meeting passepartout and fix got into the habit of chatting together the latter making it a point to gain the worthy mans confidence he frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room which passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity mentally pronouncing fix the best of good fellows
meanwhile the mongolia was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th mocha surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing was sighted and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place and thought that with its circular walls and dismantled fort it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer the following night they passed through the strait of bab-el-mandeb which means in arabic the bridge of tears and the next day they put in at steamer point north-west of aden harbour to take in coal this matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the peninsular company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year in these distant seas coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton
the mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching bombay and was obliged to remain four hours at steamer point to coal up but this delay as it was foreseen did not affect phileas foggs programme; besides the mongolia instead of reaching aden on the morning of the 15th when she was due arrived there on the evening of the 14th a gain of fifteen hours
mr fogg and his servant went ashore at aden to have the passport again visaed; fix unobserved followed them the visa procured mr fogg returned on board to resume his former habits; while passepartout according to custom sauntered about among the mixed population of somalis banyans parsees jews arabs and europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of aden he gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the gibraltar of the indian ocean and the vast cisterns where the english engineers were still at work two thousand years after the engineers of solomon
very curious very curious said passepartout to himself on returning to the steamer i see that it is by no means useless to travel if a man wants to see something new at six pm the mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead and was soon once more on the indian ocean she had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach bombay and the sea was favourable the wind being in the north-west and all sails aiding the engine the steamer rolled but little the ladies in fresh toilets reappeared on deck and the singing and dancing were resumed the trip was being accomplished most successfully and passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful fix on sunday october 20th towards noon they came in sight of the indian coast: two hours later the pilot came on board a range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon and soon the rows of palms which adorn bombay came distinctly into view the steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of bombay
phileas fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage and his partner and himself having by a bold stroke captured all thirteen of the tricks concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory
the mongolia was due at bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the 20th this was a gain to phileas fogg of two days since his departure from london and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary in the column of gains
chapter x in which passepartout is only too glad to get off with the loss of his shoes
everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land with its base in the north and its apex in the south which is called india embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls the british crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country and has a governor-general stationed at calcutta governors at madras bombay and in bengal and a lieutenant-governor at agra
but british india properly so called only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles and a population of from one hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants a considerable portion of india is still free from british authority; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent the celebrated east india company was all-powerful from 1756 when the english first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of madras down to the time of the great sepoy insurrection it gradually annexed province after province purchasing them of the native chiefs whom it seldom paid and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates civil and military but the east india company has now passed away leaving the british possessions in india directly under the control of the crown the aspect of the country as well as the manners and distinctions of race is daily changing
formerly one was obliged to travel in india by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback in palanquins or unwieldy coaches; now fast steamboats ply on the indus and the ganges and a great railway with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route traverses the peninsula from bombay to calcutta in three days this railway does not run in a direct line across india the distance between bombay and calcutta as the bird flies is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third
the general route of the great indian peninsula railway is as follows: leaving bombay it passes through salcette crossing to the continent opposite tannah goes over the chain of the western ghauts runs thence north-east as far as burhampoor skirts the nearly independent territory of bundelcund ascends to allahabad turns thence eastwardly meeting the ganges at benares then departs from the river a little and descending south-eastward by burdivan and the french town of chandernagor has its terminus at calcutta
the passengers of the mongolia went ashore at half-past four pm; at exactly eight the train would start for calcutta
mr fogg after bidding good-bye to his whist partners left the steamer gave his servant several errands to do urged it upon him to be at the station promptly at eight and with his regular step which beat to the second like an astronomical clock directed his steps to the passport office as for the wonders of bombay--its famous city hall its splendid library its forts and docks its bazaars mosques synagogues its armenian churches and the noble pagoda on malabar hill with its two polygonal towers--he cared not a straw to see them he would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of elephanta or the mysterious hypogea concealed south-east from the docks or those fine remains of buddhist architecture the kanherian grottoes of the island of salcette
having transacted his business at the passport office phileas fogg repaired quietly to the railway station where he ordered dinner among the dishes served up to him the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of native rabbit on which he prided himself
mr fogg accordingly tasted the dish but despite its spiced sauce found it far from palatable he rang for the landlord and on his appearance said fixing his clear eyes upon him is this rabbit sir?
yes my lord the rogue boldly replied rabbit from the jungles
and this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?
mew my lord what a rabbit mew i swear to you--
be so good landlord as not to swear but remember this: cats were formerly considered in india as sacred animals that was a good time
for the cats my lord? perhaps for the travellers as well
after which mr fogg quietly continued his dinner fix had gone on shore shortly after mr fogg and his first destination was the headquarters of the bombay police he made himself known as a london detective told his business at bombay and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from london it had not reached the office; indeed there had not yet been time for it to arrive fix was sorely disappointed and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the bombay police this the director refused as the matter concerned the london office which alone could legally deliver the warrant fix did not insist and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in bombay he did not doubt for a moment any more than passepartout that phileas fogg would remain there at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive
passepartout however had no sooner heard his masters orders on leaving the mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave bombay as they had done suez and paris and that the journey would be extended at least as far as calcutta and perhaps beyond that place he began to ask himself if this bet that mr fogg talked about was not really in good earnest and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him despite his love of repose around the world in eighty days
having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes he took a leisurely promenade about the streets where crowds of people of many nationalities--europeans persians with pointed caps banyas with round turbans sindes with square bonnets parsees with black mitres and long-robed armenians--were collected it happened to be the day of a parsee festival these descendants of the sect of zoroaster--the most thrifty civilised intelligent and austere of the east indians among whom are counted the richest native merchants of bombay--were celebrating a sort of religious carnival with processions and shows in the midst of which indian dancing-girls clothed in rose-coloured gauze looped up with gold and silver danced airily but with perfect modesty to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines it is needless to say that passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable
unhappily for his master as well as himself his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go at last having seen the parsee carnival wind away in the distance he was turning his steps towards the station when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on malabar hill and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior he was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to christians to enter certain indian temples and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door it may be said here that the wise policy of the british government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions
passepartout however thinking no harm went in like a simple tourist and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging he looked up to behold three enraged priests who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes and began to beat him with loud savage exclamations the agile frenchman was soon upon his feet again and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes; then rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets
at five minutes before eight passepartout hatless shoeless and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes rushed breathlessly into the station
fix who had followed mr fogg to the station and saw that he was really going to leave bombay was there upon the platform he had resolved to follow the supposed robber to calcutta and farther if necessary passepartout did not observe the detective who stood in an obscure corner; but fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to mr fogg
i hope that this will not happen again said phileas fogg coldly as he got into the train poor passepartout quite crestfallen followed his master without a word fix was on the point of entering another carriage when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan
no ill stay muttered he an offence has been committed on indian soil ive got my man
just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech and the train passed out into the darkness of the night
chapter xi in which phileas fogg secures a curious means of conveyance at a fabulous price
the train had started punctually among the passengers were a number of officers government officials and opium and indigo merchants whose business called them to the eastern coast passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them this was sir francis cromarty one of mr foggs whist partners on the mongolia now on his way to join his corps at benares sir francis was a tall fair man of fifty who had greatly distinguished himself in the last sepoy revolt he made india his home only paying brief visits to england at rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs history and character of india and its people but phileas fogg who was not travelling but only describing a circumference took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe according to the laws of rational mechanics he was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from london and had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction sir francis cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion--although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards and between two rubbers--and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior and whether phileas fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature the brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that of all the eccentric persons he had ever met none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences
phileas fogg had not concealed from sir francis his design of going round the world nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense in the way this strange gentleman was going on he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else
an hour after leaving bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the island of salcette and had got into the open country at callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern india by kandallah and pounah; and passing pauwell they entered the defiles of the mountains with their basalt bases and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests phileas fogg and sir francis cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time and now sir francis reviving the conversation observed some years ago mr fogg you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager
how so sir francis? because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to kandallah on the other side
such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least said mr fogg i have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles
but mr fogg pursued sir francis you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellows adventure at the pagoda passepartout his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him the government is very severe upon that kind of offence it takes particular care that the religious customs of the indians should be respected and if your servant were caught--
very well sir francis replied mr fogg; if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished and then would have quietly returned to europe i dont see how this affair could have delayed his master
the conversation fell again during the night the train left the mountains behind and passed nassik and the next day proceeded over the flat well-cultivated country of the khandeish with its straggling villages above which rose the minarets of the pagodas this fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams mostly tributaries of the godavery
passepartout on waking and looking out could not realise that he was actually crossing india in a railway train the locomotive guided by an english engineer and fed with english coal threw out its smoke upon cotton coffee nutmeg clove and pepper plantations while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries) and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of indian architecture then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway and still haunted by elephants which with pensive eyes gazed at the train as it passed the travellers crossed beyond milligaum the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess kali not far off rose ellora with its graceful pagodas and the famous aurungabad capital of the ferocious aureng-zeb now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the nizam it was thereabouts that feringhea the thuggee chief king of the stranglers held his sway these ruffians united by a secret bond strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess death without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction the english government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders though the thuggees still exist and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites
at half-past twelve the train stopped at burhampoor where passepartout was able to purchase some indian slippers ornamented with false pearls in which with evident vanity he proceeded to encase his feet the travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for assurghur after skirting for a little the banks of the small river tapty which empties into the gulf of cambray near surat
passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie up to his arrival at bombay he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but now that they were plainly whirling across india at full speed a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams his old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him he came to regard his masters project as intended in good earnest believed in the reality of the bet and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period already he began to worry about possible delays and accidents which might happen on the way he recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before being much less cool-headed than mr fogg he was much more restless counting and recounting the days passed over uttering maledictions when the train stopped and accusing it of sluggishness and mentally blaming mr fogg for not having bribed the engineer the worthy fellow was ignorant that while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer it could not be done on the railway
the train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains which separate the khandeish from bundelcund towards evening the next day sir francis cromarty asked passepartout what time it was; to which on consulting his watch he replied that it was three in the morning this famous timepiece always regulated on the greenwich meridian which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward was at least four hours slow sir francis corrected passepartouts time whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian since he was constantly going eastward that is in the face of the sun and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch which he kept at london time it was an innocent delusion which could harm no one
the train stopped at eight oclock in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond rothal where there were several bungalows and workmens cabins the conductor passing along the carriages shouted passengers will get out here
phileas fogg looked at sir francis cromarty for an explanation; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias
passepartout not less surprised rushed out and speedily returned crying: monsieur no more railway
what do you mean? asked sir francis
i mean to say that the train isnt going on
the general at once stepped out while phileas fogg calmly followed him and they proceeded together to the conductor
where are we? asked sir francis
at the hamlet of kholby do we stop here?
certainly the railway isnt finished what not finished?
no theres still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to allahabad where the line begins again
but the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout
what would you have officer? the papers were mistaken
yet you sell tickets from bombay to calcutta retorted sir francis who was growing warm
no doubt replied the conductor; but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from kholby to allahabad
sir francis was furious passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down and did not dare to look at his master
sir francis said mr fogg quietly we will if you please look about for some means of conveyance to allahabad
mr fogg this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage
no sir francis; it was foreseen
what you knew that the way--
not at all; but i knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route nothing therefore is lost i have two days which i have already gained to sacrifice a steamer leaves calcutta for hong kong at noon on the 25th this is the 22nd and we shall reach calcutta in time
there was nothing to say to so confident a response
it was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point the papers were like some watches which have a way of getting too fast and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line the greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption and leaving the train they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis waggons drawn by zebus carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas palanquins ponies and what not
mr fogg and sir francis cromarty after searching the village from end to end came back without having found anything
i shall go afoot said phileas fogg
passepartout who had now rejoined his master made a wry grimace as he thought of his magnificent but too frail indian shoes happily he too had been looking about him and after a moments hesitation said monsieur i think i have found a means of conveyance
what? an elephant an elephant that belongs to an indian who lives but a hundred steps from here
lets go and see the elephant replied mr fogg
they soon reached a small hut near which enclosed within some high palings was the animal in question an indian came out of the hut and at their request conducted them within the enclosure the elephant which its owner had reared not for a beast of burden but for warlike purposes was half domesticated the indian had begun already by often irritating him and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature this method being often employed by those who train the indian elephants for battle happily however for mr fogg the animals instruction in this direction had not gone far and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time and in default of any other means of conveyance mr fogg resolved to hire him but elephants are far from cheap in india where they are becoming scarce the males which alone are suitable for circus shows are much sought especially as but few of them are domesticated when therefore mr fogg proposed to the indian to hire kiouni he refused point-blank mr fogg persisted offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to allahabad refused twenty pounds? refused also forty pounds? still refused passepartout jumped at each advance; but the indian declined to be tempted yet the offer was an alluring one for supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach allahabad his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling
phileas fogg without getting in the least flurried then proposed to purchase the animal outright and at first offered a thousand pounds for him the indian perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain still refused
sir francis cromarty took mr fogg aside and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value returning to the indian whose small sharp eyes glistening with avarice betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain mr fogg offered first twelve hundred then fifteen hundred eighteen hundred two thousand pounds passepartout usually so rubicund was fairly white with suspense
at two thousand pounds the indian yielded
what a price good heavens cried passepartout for an elephant
it only remained now to find a guide which was comparatively easy a young parsee with an intelligent face offered his services which mr fogg accepted promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal the elephant was led out and equipped the parsee who was an accomplished elephant driver covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs phileas fogg paid the indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor passepartout of his vitals then he offered to carry sir francis to allahabad which the brigadier gratefully accepted as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast provisions were purchased at kholby and while sir francis and mr fogg took the howdahs on either side passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them the parsee perched himself on the elephants neck and at nine oclock they set out from the village the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut
chapter xii in which phileas fogg and his companions venture across the indian forests and what ensued
in order to shorten the journey the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built this line owing to the capricious turnings of the vindhia mountains did not pursue a straight course the parsee who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest
phileas fogg and sir francis cromarty plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant spurred on as he was by the skilful parsee; but they endured the discomfort with true british phlegm talking little and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other as for passepartout who was mounted on the beasts back and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along he was very careful in accordance with his masters advice to keep his tongue from between his teeth as it would otherwise have been bitten off short the worthy fellow bounced from the elephants neck to his rump and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket and inserted it in kiounis trunk who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot
after two hours the guide stopped the elephant and gave him an hour for rest during which kiouni after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him neither sir francis nor mr fogg regretted the delay and both descended with a feeling of relief why hes made of iron exclaimed the general gazing admiringly on kiouni
of forged iron replied passepartout as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast
at noon the parsee gave the signal of departure the country soon presented a very savage aspect copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests; then vast dry plains dotted with scanty shrubs and sown with great blocks of syenite all this portion of bundelcund which is little frequented by travellers is inhabited by a fanatical population hardened in the most horrible practices of the hindoo faith the english have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory which is subjected to the influence of rajahs whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses the travellers several times saw bands of ferocious indians who when they perceived the elephant striding across-country made angry and threatening motions the parsee avoided them as much as possible few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed passepartout with laughter
in the midst of his gaiety however one thought troubled the worthy servant what would mr fogg do with the elephant when he got to allahabad? would he carry him on with him? impossible the cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive would he sell him or set him free? the estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration should mr fogg choose to make him passepartout a present of kiouni he would be very much embarrassed; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time
the principal chain of the vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening and another halt was made on the northern slope in a ruined bungalow they had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day and an equal distance still separated them from the station of allahabad
the night was cold the parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches and the warmth was very grateful provisions purchased at kholby sufficed for supper and the travellers ate ravenously the conversation beginning with a few disconnected phrases soon gave place to loud and steady snores the guide watched kiouni who slept standing bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow sir francis slept heavily like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before as for mr fogg he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in saville row
the journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach allahabad by evening in that case mr fogg would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour kiouni resuming his rapid gait soon descended the lower spurs of the vindhias and towards noon they passed by the village of kallenger on the cani one of the branches of the ganges the guide avoided inhabited places thinking it safer to keep the open country which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east they stopped under a clump of bananas the fruit of which as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream was amply partaken of and appreciated
at two oclock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods they had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished when the elephant becoming restless suddenly stopped
it was then four oclock whats the matter? asked sir francis putting out his head
i dont know officer replied the parsee listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches
the murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments passepartout was all eyes and ears mr fogg patiently waited without a word the parsee jumped to the ground fastened the elephant to a tree and plunged into the thicket he soon returned saying:
a procession of brahmins is coming this way we must prevent their seeing us if possible
the guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket at the same time asking the travellers not to stir he held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moments notice should flight become necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage in which they were wholly concealed
the discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals the head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches first came the priests with mitres on their heads and clothed in long lace robes they were surrounded by men women and children who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other upon the car which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus stood a hideous statue with four arms the body coloured a dull red with haggard eyes dishevelled hair protruding tongue and lips tinted with betel it stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant
sir francis recognising the statue whispered the goddess kali; the goddess of love and death
of death perhaps muttered back passepartout but of love--that ugly old hag? never
the parsee made a motion to keep silence
a group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue; these were striped with ochre and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics who in the great indian ceremonies still throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut some brahmins clad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel and leading a woman who faltered at every step followed this woman was young and as fair as a european her head and neck shoulders ears arms hands and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets earrings and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold and covered with a light muslin robe betrayed the outline of her form
the guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists and long damascened pistols and bearing a corpse on a palanquin it was the body of an old man gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah wearing as in life a turban embroidered with pearls a robe of tissue of silk and gold a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds and the magnificent weapons of a hindoo prince next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments; these closed the procession
sir francis watched the procession with a sad countenance and turning to the guide said a suttee
the parsee nodded and put his finger to his lips the procession slowly wound under the trees and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood the songs gradually died away; occasionally cries were heard in the distance until at last all was silence again
phileas fogg had heard what sir francis said and as soon as the procession had disappeared asked: what is a suttee?
a suttee returned the general is a human sacrifice but a voluntary one the woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day
oh the scoundrels cried passepartout who could not repress his indignation
and the corpse? asked mr fogg
is that of the prince her husband said the guide; an independent rajah of bundelcund
is it possible resumed phileas fogg his voice betraying not the least emotion that these barbarous customs still exist in india and that the english have been unable to put a stop to them?
these sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of india replied sir francis; but we have no power over these savage territories and especially here in bundelcund the whole district north of the vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage
the poor wretch exclaimed passepartout to be burned alive
yes returned sir francis burned alive and if she were not you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives they would shave off her hair feed her on a scanty allowance of rice treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature and would die in some corner like a scurvy dog the prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism sometimes however the sacrifice is really voluntary and it requires the active interference of the government to prevent it several years ago when i was living at bombay a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husbands body; but as you may imagine he refused the woman left the town took refuge with an independent rajah and there carried out her self-devoted purpose
while sir francis was speaking the guide shook his head several times and now said: the sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one
how do you know? everybody knows about this affair in bundelcund
but the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance observed sir francis
that was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium
but where are they taking her?
to the pagoda of pillaji two miles from here; she will pass the night there
and the sacrifice will take place--
to-morrow at the first light of dawn
the guide now led the elephant out of the thicket and leaped upon his neck just at the moment that he was about to urge kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle mr fogg stopped him and turning to sir francis cromarty said suppose we save this woman
save the woman mr fogg i have yet twelve hours to spare; i can devote them to that
why you are a man of heart
sometimes replied phileas fogg quietly; when i have the time
chapter xiii in which passepartout receives a new proof that fortune favors the brave
the project was a bold one full of difficulty perhaps impracticable mr fogg was going to risk life or at least liberty and therefore the success of his tour but he did not hesitate and he found in sir francis cromarty an enthusiastic ally
as for passepartout he was ready for anything that might be proposed his masters idea charmed him; he perceived a heart a soul under that icy exterior he began to love phileas fogg
there remained the guide: what course would he adopt? would he not take part with the indians? in default of his assistance it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality
sir francis frankly put the question to him
officers replied the guide i am a parsee and this woman is a parsee command me as you will
excellent said mr fogg however resumed the guide it is certain not only that we shall risk our lives but horrible tortures if we are taken
that is foreseen replied mr fogg i think we must wait till night before acting
i think so said the guide
the worthy indian then gave some account of the victim who he said was a celebrated beauty of the parsee race and the daughter of a wealthy bombay merchant she had received a thoroughly english education in that city and from her manners and intelligence would be thought an european her name was aouda left an orphan she was married against her will to the old rajah of bundelcund; and knowing the fate that awaited her she escaped was retaken and devoted by the rajahs relatives who had an interest in her death to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape
the parsees narrative only confirmed mr fogg and his companions in their generous design it was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of pillaji which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible they halted half an hour afterwards in a copse some five hundred feet from the pagoda where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly
they then discussed the means of getting at the victim the guide was familiar with the pagoda of pillaji in which as he declared the young woman was imprisoned could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of indians was plunged in a drunken sleep or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls? this could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night and not when at break of day the victim was led to her funeral pyre then no human intervention could save her
as soon as night fell about six oclock they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda the cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself
the parsee leading the others noiselessly crept through the wood and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream whence by the light of the rosin torches they perceived a pyre of wood on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah which was to be burned with his wife the pagoda whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk stood a hundred steps away
come whispered the guide he slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches
soon the parsee stopped on the borders of the glade which was lit up by the torches the ground was covered by groups of the indians motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead men women and children lay together
in the background among the trees the pagoda of pillaji loomed distinctly much to the guides disappointment the guards of the rajah lighted by torches were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests too were watching within
the parsee now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple advanced no farther but led his companions back again phileas fogg and sir francis cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction they stopped and engaged in a whispered colloquy
it is only eight now said the brigadier and these guards may also go to sleep
it is not impossible returned the parsee
they lay down at the foot of a tree and waited
the time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda
they waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on the other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made it remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door
after a last consultation the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt and advanced followed by the others they took a roundabout way so as to get at the pagoda on the rear they reached the walls about half-past twelve without having met anyone; here there was no guard nor were there either windows or doors
the night was dark the moon on the wane scarcely left the horizon and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness
it was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out the rest would yield easily
they set noiselessly to work and the parsee on one side and passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide they were getting on rapidly when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside passepartout and the guide stopped had they been heard? was the alarm being given? common prudence urged them to retire and they did so followed by phileas fogg and sir francis they again hid themselves in the wood and waited till the disturbance whatever it might be ceased holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay but awkwardly enough the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple and there installed themselves in readiness to prevent a surprise
it would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party thus interrupted in their work they could not now reach the victim; how then could they save her? sir francis shook his fists passepartout was beside himself and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage the tranquil fogg waited without betraying any emotion
we have nothing to do but to go away whispered sir francis
nothing but to go away echoed the guide
stop said fogg i am only due at allahabad tomorrow before noon
but what can you hope to do? asked sir francis in a few hours it will be daylight and--
the chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment
sir francis would have liked to read phileas foggs eyes what was this cool englishman thinking of? was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice and boldly snatch her from her executioners?
this would be utter folly and it was hard to admit that fogg was such a fool sir francis consented however to remain to the end of this terrible drama the guide led them to the rear of the glade where they were able to observe the sleeping groups
meanwhile passepartout who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash and which was now firmly lodged in his brain
he had commenced by saying to himself what folly and then he repeated why not after all? its a chance--perhaps the only one; and with such sots thinking thus he slipped with the suppleness of a serpent to the lowest branches the ends of which bent almost to the ground
the hours passed and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day though it was not yet light this was the moment the slumbering multitude became animated the tambourines sounded songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come the doors of the pagoda swung open and a bright light escaped from its interior in the midst of which mr fogg and sir francis espied the victim she seemed having shaken off the stupor of intoxication to be striving to escape from her executioner sir franciss heart throbbed; and convulsively seizing mr foggs hand found in it an open knife just at this moment the crowd began to move the young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp and passed among the fakirs who escorted her with their wild religious cries
phileas fogg and his companions mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream and stopped fifty paces from the pyre upon which still lay the rajahs corpse in the semi-obscurity they saw the victim quite senseless stretched out beside her husbands body then a torch was brought and the wood heavily soaked with oil instantly took fire
at this moment sir francis and the guide seized phileas fogg who in an instant of mad generosity was about to rush upon the pyre but he had quickly pushed them aside when the whole scene suddenly changed a cry of terror arose the whole multitude prostrated themselves terror-stricken on the ground
the old rajah was not dead then since he rose of a sudden like a spectre took up his wife in his arms and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke which only heightened his ghostly appearance
fakirs and soldiers and priests seized with instant terror lay there with their faces on the ground not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy
the inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her and which she did not seem in the least to burden mr fogg and sir francis stood erect the parsee bowed his head and passepartout was no doubt scarcely less stupefied
the resuscitated rajah approached sir francis and mr fogg and in an abrupt tone said let us be off
it was passepartout himself who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and profiting by the still overhanging darkness had delivered the young woman from death it was passepartout who playing his part with a happy audacity had passed through the crowd amid the general terror
a moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace but the cries and noise and a ball which whizzed through phileas foggs hat apprised them that the trick had been discovered
the old rajahs body indeed now appeared upon the burning pyre; and the priests recovered from their terror perceived that an abduction had taken place they hastened into the forest followed by the soldiers who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows
chapter xiv in which phileas fogg descends the whole length of the beautiful valley of the ganges without ever thinking of seeing it
the rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour passepartout laughed gaily at his success sir francis pressed the worthy fellows hand and his master said well done which from him was high commendation; to which passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to mr fogg as for him he had only been struck with a queer idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he passepartout the ex-gymnast ex-sergeant fireman had been the spouse of a charming woman a venerable embalmed rajah as for the young indian woman she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing and now wrapped up in a travelling-blanket was reposing in one of the howdahs
the elephant thanks to the skilful guidance of the parsee was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest and an hour after leaving the pagoda had crossed a vast plain they made a halt at seven oclock the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration the guide made her drink a little brandy and water but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off sir francis who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp reassured his companions on her account but he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate he told phileas fogg that should aouda remain in india she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners these fanatics were scattered throughout the county and would despite the english police recover their victim at madras bombay or calcutta she would only be safe by quitting india for ever
phileas fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter
the station at allahabad was reached about ten oclock and the interrupted line of railway being resumed would enable them to reach calcutta in less than twenty-four hours phileas fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left calcutta the next day october 25th at noon for hong kong
the young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station whilst passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet a dress shawl and some furs; for which his master gave him unlimited credit passepartout started off forthwith and found himself in the streets of allahabad that is the city of god one of the most venerated in india being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers ganges and jumna the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula the ganges according to the legends of the ramayana rises in heaven whence owing to brahmas agency it descends to the earth
passepartout made it a point as he made his purchases to take a good look at the city it was formerly defended by a noble fort which has since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away and passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in regent street at last he came upon an elderly crusty jew who sold second-hand articles and from whom he purchased a dress of scotch stuff a large mantle and a fine otter-skin pelisse for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds he then returned triumphantly to the station
the influence to which the priests of pillaji had subjected aouda began gradually to yield and she became more herself so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft indian expression
when the poet-king ucaf uddaul celebrates the charms of the queen of ahmehnagara he speaks thus:
her shining tresses divided in two parts encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks brilliant in their glow and freshness her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of kama the god of love and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim as in the sacred lakes of himalaya in the black pupils of her great clear eyes her teeth fine equal and white glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flowers half-enveloped breast her delicately formed ears her vermilion hands her little feet curved and tender as the lotus-bud glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of ceylon the most dazzling diamonds of golconda her narrow and supple waist which a hand may clasp around sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of vicvarcarma the immortal sculptor
it is enough to say without applying this poetical rhapsody to aouda that she was a charming woman in all the european acceptation of the phrase she spoke english with great purity and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young parsee had been transformed by her bringing up
the train was about to start from allahabad and mr fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service and not a farthing more; which astonished passepartout who remembered all that his master owed to the guides devotion he had indeed risked his life in the adventure at pillaji and if he should be caught afterwards by the indians he would with difficulty escape their vengeance kiouni also must be disposed of what should be done with the elephant which had been so dearly purchased? phileas fogg had already determined this question
parsee said he to the guide you have been serviceable and devoted i have paid for your service but not for your devotion would you like to have this elephant? he is yours
the guides eyes glistened your honour is giving me a fortune cried he
take him guide returned mr fogg and i shall still be your debtor
good exclaimed passepartout take him friend kiouni is a brave and faithful beast and going up to the elephant he gave him several lumps of sugar saying here kiouni here here
the elephant grunted out his satisfaction and clasping passepartout around the waist with his trunk lifted him as high as his head passepartout not in the least alarmed caressed the animal which replaced him gently on the ground
soon after phileas fogg sir francis cromarty and passepartout installed in a carriage with aouda who had the best seat were whirling at full speed towards benares it was a run of eighty miles and was accomplished in two hours during the journey the young woman fully recovered her senses what was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage on the railway dressed in european habiliments and with travellers who were quite strangers to her her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor and then sir francis narrated to her what had passed dwelling upon the courage with which phileas fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her and recounting the happy sequel of the venture the result of passepartouts rash idea mr fogg said nothing; while passepartout abashed kept repeating that it wasnt worth telling
aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips then as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice and recalled the dangers which still menaced her she shuddered with terror
phileas fogg understood what was passing in aoudas mind and offered in order to reassure her to escort her to hong kong where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up--an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted she had it seems a parsee relation who was one of the principal merchants of hong kong which is wholly an english city though on an island on the chinese coast
at half-past twelve the train stopped at benares the brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient casi which like mahomets tomb was once suspended between heaven and earth; though the benares of to-day which the orientalists call the athens of india stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts giving an aspect of desolation to the place as the train entered it
benares was sir francis cromartys destination the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city he bade adieu to phileas fogg wishing him all success and expressing the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion mr fogg lightly pressed him by the hand the parting of aouda who did not forget what she owed to sir francis betrayed more warmth; and as for passepartout he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general
the railway on leaving benares passed for a while along the valley of the ganges through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of behar with its mountains clothed in verdure its fields of barley wheat and corn its jungles peopled with green alligators its neat villages and its still thickly-leaved forests elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river and groups of indians despite the advanced season and chilly air were performing solemnly their pious ablutions these were fervent brahmins the bitterest foes of buddhism their deities being vishnu the solar god shiva the divine impersonation of natural forces and brahma the supreme ruler of priests and legislators what would these divinities think of india anglicised as it is to-day with steamers whistling and scudding along the ganges frightening the gulls which float upon its surface the turtles swarming along its banks and the faithful dwelling upon its borders?
the panorama passed before their eyes like a flash save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of chupenie twenty miles south-westward from benares the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of behar; or ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of lord cornwallis rising on the left bank of the ganges; the fortified town of buxar or patna a large manufacturing and trading-place where is held the principal opium market of india; or monghir a more than european town for it is as english as manchester or birmingham with its iron foundries edgetool factories and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward
night came on; the train passed on at full speed in the midst of the roaring of the tigers bears and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of bengal golconda ruined gour murshedabad the ancient capital burdwan hugly and the french town of chandernagor where passepartout would have been proud to see his countrys flag flying were hidden from their view in the darkness
calcutta was reached at seven in the morning and the packet left for hong kong at noon; so that phileas fogg had five hours before him
according to his journal he was due at calcutta on the 25th of october and that was the exact date of his actual arrival he was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time the two days gained between london and bombay had been lost as has been seen in the journey across india but it is not to be supposed that phileas fogg regretted them
chapter xv in which the bag of banknotes disgorges some thousands of pounds more
the train entered the station and passepartout jumping out first was followed by mr fogg who assisted his fair companion to descend phileas fogg intended to proceed at once to the hong kong steamer in order to get aouda comfortably settled for the voyage he was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground
just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him and said mr phileas fogg?
i am he is this man your servant? added the policeman pointing to passepartout
yes be so good both of you as to follow me
mr fogg betrayed no surprise whatever the policeman was a representative of the law and law is sacred to an englishman passepartout tried to reason about the matter but the policeman tapped him with his stick and mr fogg made him a signal to obey
may this young lady go with us? asked he
she may replied the policeman mr fogg aouda and passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri a sort of four-wheeled carriage drawn by two horses in which they took their places and were driven away no one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination they first passed through the black town with its narrow streets its miserable dirty huts and squalid population; then through the european town which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts where although it was early morning elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth
the carriage stopped before a modest-looking house which however did not have the appearance of a private mansion the policeman having requested his prisoners--for so truly they might be called--to descend conducted them into a room with barred windows and said: you will appear before judge obadiah at half-past eight
he then retired and closed the door
why we are prisoners exclaimed passepartout falling into a chair
aouda with an emotion she tried to conceal said to mr fogg: sir you must leave me to my fate it is on my account that you receive this treatment it is for having saved me
phileas fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible it was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee the complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge there was some mistake moreover he would not in any event abandon aouda but would escort her to hong kong
but the steamer leaves at noon observed passepartout nervously
we shall be on board by noon replied his master placidly
it was said so positively that passepartout could not help muttering to himself parbleu thats certain before noon we shall be on board but he was by no means reassured
at half-past eight the door opened the policeman appeared and requesting them to follow him led the way to an adjoining hall it was evidently a court-room and a crowd of europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment
mr fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk immediately after judge obadiah a fat round man followed by the clerk entered he proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail and put it hurriedly on his head
the first case said he then putting his hand to his head he exclaimed heh this is not my wig
no your worship returned the clerk it is mine
my dear mr oysterpuff how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerks wig?
the wigs were exchanged passepartout was getting nervous for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity
the first case repeated judge obadiah
phileas fogg? demanded oysterpuff i am here replied mr fogg
passepartout? present responded passepartout good said the judge you have been looked for prisoners for two days on the trains from bombay
but of what are we accused? asked passepartout impatiently
you are about to be informed
i am an english subject sir said mr fogg and i have the right--
have you been ill-treated? not at all
very well; let the complainants come in
a door was swung open by order of the judge and three indian priests entered
thats it muttered passepartout; these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady
the priests took their places in front of the judge and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against phileas fogg and his servant who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the brahmin religion
you hear the charge? asked the judge
yes sir replied mr fogg consulting his watch and i admit it
you admit it? i admit it and i wish to hear these priests admit in their turn what they were going to do at the pagoda of pillaji
the priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said
yes cried passepartout warmly; at the pagoda of pillaji where they were on the point of burning their victim
the judge stared with astonishment and the priests were stupefied
what victim? said judge obadiah burn whom? in bombay itself?
bombay? cried passepartout certainly we are not talking of the pagoda of pillaji but of the pagoda of malabar hill at bombay
and as a proof added the clerk here are the desecrators very shoes which he left behind him
whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk
my shoes cried passepartout in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him
the confusion of master and man who had quite forgotten the affair at bombay for which they were now detained at calcutta may be imagined
fix the detective had foreseen the advantage which passepartouts escapade gave him and delaying his departure for twelve hours had consulted the priests of malabar hill knowing that the english authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour he promised them a goodly sum in damages and sent them forward to calcutta by the next train owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow fix and the priests reached the indian capital before mr fogg and his servant the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive fixs disappointment when he learned that phileas fogg had not made his appearance in calcutta may be imagined he made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces for twenty-four hours fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing mr fogg and passepartout arrive accompanied by a young woman whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain he hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before judge obadiah
had passepartout been a little less preoccupied he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had failed to reach him at calcutta as it had done at bombay and suez
judge obadiah had unfortunately caught passepartouts rash exclamation which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall
the facts are admitted? asked the judge
admitted replied mr fogg coldly inasmuch resumed the judge as the english law protects equally and sternly the religions of the indian people and as the man passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of malabar hill at bombay on the 20th of october i condemn the said passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds
three hundred pounds cried passepartout startled at the largeness of the sum
silence shouted the constable and inasmuch continued the judge as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant i condemn phileas fogg to a weeks imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds
fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if phileas fogg could be detained in calcutta a week it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive passepartout was stupefied this sentence ruined his master a wager of twenty thousand pounds lost because he like a precious fool had gone into that abominable pagoda
phileas fogg as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced just as the clerk was calling the next case he rose and said i offer bail
you have that right returned the judge
fixs blood ran cold but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds
i will pay it at once said mr fogg taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag which passepartout had by him and placing them on the clerks desk
this sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison said the judge meanwhile you are liberated on bail
come said phileas fogg to his servant
but let them at least give me back my shoes cried passepartout angrily
ah these are pretty dear shoes he muttered as they were handed to him more than a thousand pounds apiece; besides they pinch my feet
mr fogg offering his arm to aouda then departed followed by the crestfallen passepartout fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not after all leave the two thousand pounds behind him but would decide to serve out his week in jail and issued forth on mr foggs traces that gentleman took a carriage and the party were soon landed on one of the quays
the rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head eleven oclock was striking; mr fogg was an hour in advance of time fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer and stamped his feet with disappointment
the rascal is off after all he exclaimed two thousand pounds sacrificed hes as prodigal as a thief ill follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but at the rate he is going on the stolen money will soon be exhausted
the detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture since leaving london what with travelling expenses bribes the purchase of the elephant bails and fines mr fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives was rapidly diminishing
chapter xvi in which fix does not seem to understand in the least what is said to him
the rangoon--one of the peninsular and oriental companys boats plying in the chinese and japanese seas--was a screw steamer built of iron weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons and with engines of four hundred horse-power she was as fast but not as well fitted up as the mongolia and aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as phileas fogg could have wished however the trip from calcutta to hong kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles occupying from ten to twelve days and the young woman was not difficult to please
during the first days of the journey aouda became better acquainted with her protector and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done the phlegmatic gentleman listened to her apparently at least with coldness neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to aoudas comfort he visited her regularly each day at certain hours not so much to talk himself as to sit and hear her talk he treated her with the strictest politeness but with the precision of an automaton the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose aouda did not quite know what to make of him though passepartout had given her some hints of his masters eccentricity and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world after all she owed phileas fogg her life and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude
aouda confirmed the parsee guides narrative of her touching history she did indeed belong to the highest of the native races of india many of the parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them sir jametsee jeejeebhoy was made a baronet by the english government aouda was a relative of this great man and it was his cousin jeejeeh whom she hoped to join at hong kong whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but mr fogg essayed to calm her anxieties and to assure her that everything would be mathematically--he used the very word--arranged aouda fastened her great eyes clear as the sacred lakes of the himalaya upon him; but the intractable fogg as reserved as ever did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake
the first few days of the voyage passed prosperously amid favourable weather and propitious winds and they soon came in sight of the great andaman the principal of the islands in the bay of bengal with its picturesque saddle peak two thousand four hundred feet high looming above the waters the steamer passed along near the shores but the savage papuans who are in the lowest scale of humanity but are not as has been asserted cannibals did not make their appearance
the panorama of the islands as they steamed by them was superb vast forests of palms arecs bamboo teakwood of the gigantic mimosa and tree-like ferns covered the foreground while behind the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the celestial empire the varied landscape afforded by the andaman islands was soon passed however and the rangoon rapidly approached the straits of malacca which gave access to the china seas
what was detective fix so unluckily drawn on from country to country doing all this while? he had managed to embark on the rangoon at calcutta without being seen by passepartout after leaving orders that if the warrant should arrive it should be forwarded to him at hong kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage it would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening passepartouts suspicions who thought him still at bombay but necessity impelled him nevertheless to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant as will be seen
all the detectives hopes and wishes were now centred on hong kong; for the steamers stay at singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there the arrest must be made at hong kong or the robber would probably escape him for ever hong kong was the last english ground on which he would set foot; beyond china japan america offered to fogg an almost certain refuge if the warrant should at last make its appearance at hong kong fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police and there would be no further trouble but beyond hong kong a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary and that would result in delays and obstacles of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice
fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin and kept repeating to himself now either the warrant will be at hong kong in which case i shall arrest my man or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that i should delay his departure i have failed at bombay and i have failed at calcutta; if i fail at hong kong my reputation is lost: cost what it may i must succeed but how shall i prevent his departure if that should turn out to be my last resource?
fix made up his mind that if worst came to worst he would make a confidant of passepartout and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was that passepartout was not foggs accomplice he was very certain the servant enlightened by his disclosure and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime would doubtless become an ally of the detective but this method was a dangerous one only to be employed when everything else had failed a word from passepartout to his master would ruin all the detective was therefore in a sore strait but suddenly a new idea struck him the presence of aouda on the rangoon in company with phileas fogg gave him new material for reflection
who was this woman? what combination of events had made her foggs travelling companion? they had evidently met somewhere between bombay and calcutta; but where? had they met accidentally or had fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? fix was fairly puzzled he asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue whether the young woman were married or not he would be able to create such difficulties for mr fogg at hong kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money
but could he even wait till they reached hong kong? fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another and before anything could be effected might get full under way again for yokohama
fix decided that he must warn the english authorities and signal the rangoon before her arrival this was easy to do since the steamer stopped at singapore whence there is a telegraphic wire to hong kong he finally resolved moreover before acting more positively to question passepartout it would not be difficult to make him talk; and as there was no time to lose fix prepared to make himself known
it was now the 30th of october and on the following day the rangoon was due at singapore
fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer the detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise and exclaimed you here on the rangoon?
what monsieur fix are you on board? returned the really astonished passepartout recognising his crony of the mongolia why i left you at bombay and here you are on the way to hong kong are you going round the world too?
no no replied fix; i shall stop at hong kong--at least for some days
hum said passepartout who seemed for an instant perplexed but how is it i have not seen you on board since we left calcutta?
oh a trifle of sea-sickness--ive been staying in my berth the gulf of bengal does not agree with me as well as the indian ocean and how is mr fogg?
as well and as punctual as ever not a day behind time but monsieur fix you dont know that we have a young lady with us
a young lady? replied the detective not seeming to comprehend what was said
passepartout thereupon recounted aoudas history the affair at the bombay pagoda the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds the rescue the arrest and sentence of the calcutta court and the restoration of mr fogg and himself to liberty on bail fix who was familiar with the last events seemed to be equally ignorant of all that passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener
but does your master propose to carry this young woman to europe?
not at all we are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives a rich merchant at hong kong
nothing to be done there said fix to himself concealing his disappointment a glass of gin mr passepartout?
willingly monsieur fix we must at least have a friendly glass on board the rangoon
chapter xvii showing what happened on the voyage from singapore to hong kong
the detective and passepartout met often on deck after this interview though fix was reserved and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning mr fogg he caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but mr fogg usually confined himself to the cabin where he kept aouda company or according to his inveterate habit took a hand at whist
passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept fix still on the route that his master was pursuing it was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person whom he had first met at suez had then encountered on board the mongolia who disembarked at bombay which he announced as his destination and now turned up so unexpectedly on the rangoon was following mr foggs tracks step by step what was fixs object? passepartout was ready to wager his indian shoes--which he religiously preserved--that fix would also leave hong kong at the same time with them and probably on the same steamer
passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view he never could have imagined that phileas fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe but as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of fixs movements which was in truth far from unreasonable fix he thought could only be an agent of mr foggs friends at the reform club sent to follow him up and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon
its clear repeated the worthy servant to himself proud of his shrewdness hes a spy sent to keep us in view that isnt quite the thing either to be spying mr fogg who is so honourable a man ah gentlemen of the reform this shall cost you dear
passepartout enchanted with his discovery resolved to say nothing to his master lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries but he determined to chaff fix when he had the chance with mysterious allusions which however need not betray his real suspicions
during the afternoon of wednesday 30th october the rangoon entered the strait of malacca which separates the peninsula of that name from sumatra the mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers the rangoon weighed anchor at singapore the next day at four am to receive coal having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival phileas fogg noted this gain in his journal and then accompanied by aouda who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore disembarked
fix who suspected mr foggs every movement followed them cautiously without being himself perceived; while passepartout laughing in his sleeve at fixs manoeuvres went about his usual errands
the island of singapore is not imposing in aspect for there are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions it is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues a handsome carriage drawn by a sleek pair of new holland horses carried phileas fogg and aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage and of clove-trees whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of european fields; sago-bushes large ferns with gorgeous branches varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees nor were tigers wanting in the jungles
after a drive of two hours through the country aouda and mr fogg returned to the town which is a vast collection of heavy-looking irregular houses surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten oclock they re-embarked closely followed by the detective who had kept them constantly in sight
passepartout who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes--a fruit as large as good-sized apples of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within and whose white pulp melting in the mouth affords gourmands a delicious sensation--was waiting for them on deck he was only too glad to offer some mangoes to aouda who thanked him very gracefully for them
at eleven oclock the rangoon rode out of singapore harbour and in a few hours the high mountains of malacca with their forests inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world were lost to view singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of hong kong which is a little english colony near the chinese coast phileas fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of november for yokohama the principal japanese port
the rangoon had a large quota of passengers many of whom disembarked at singapore among them a number of indians ceylonese chinamen malays and portuguese mostly second-class travellers
the weather which had hitherto been fine changed with the last quarter of the moon the sea rolled heavily and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm but happily blew from the south-west and thus aided the steamers progress the captain as often as possible put up his sails and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of anam and cochin china owing to the defective construction of the rangoon however unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause while it nearly drove passepartout out of his senses did not seem to affect his master in the least passepartout blamed the captain the engineer and the crew and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows perhaps the thought of the gas which was remorselessly burning at his expense in saville row had something to do with his hot impatience
you are in a great hurry then said fix to him one day to reach hong kong?
a very great hurry mr fogg i suppose is anxious to catch the steamer for yokohama?
terribly anxious you believe in this journey around the world then?
absolutely dont you mr fix? i? i dont believe a word of it
youre a sly dog said passepartout winking at him
this expression rather disturbed fix without his knowing why had the frenchman guessed his real purpose? he knew not what to think but how could passepartout have discovered that he was a detective? yet in speaking as he did the man evidently meant more than he expressed
passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his tongue
mr fix said he in a bantering tone shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to hong kong?
why responded fix a little embarrassed i dont know; perhaps--
ah if you would only go on with us an agent of the peninsular company you know cant stop on the way you were only going to bombay and here you are in china america is not far off and from america to europe is only a step
fix looked intently at his companion whose countenance was as serene as possible and laughed with him but passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation
yes and no returned fix; there is good and bad luck in such things but you must understand that i dont travel at my own expense
oh i am quite sure of that cried passepartout laughing heartily
fix fairly puzzled descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections he was evidently suspected; somehow or other the frenchman had found out that he was a detective but had he told his master? what part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not? was the game then up? fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind sometimes thinking that all was lost then persuading himself that fogg was ignorant of his presence and then undecided what course it was best to take
nevertheless he preserved his coolness of mind and at last resolved to deal plainly with passepartout if he did not find it practicable to arrest fogg at hong kong and if fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of english territory he fix would tell passepartout all either the servant was the accomplice of his master and in this case the master knew of his operations and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery and then his interest would be to abandon the robber
such was the situation between fix and passepartout meanwhile phileas fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference he was passing methodically in his orbit around the world regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star which might have produced an agitation in this gentlemans heart but no the charms of aouda failed to act to passepartouts great surprise; and the disturbances if they existed would have been more difficult to calculate than those of uranus which led to the discovery of neptune
it was every day an increasing wonder to passepartout who read in aoudas eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master phileas fogg though brave and gallant must be he thought quite heartless as to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor passepartout existed in perpetual reveries
one day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room and was observing the engine when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water the steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made passepartout indignant
the valves are not sufficiently charged he exclaimed we are not going oh these english if this was an american craft we should blow up perhaps but we should at all events go faster
chapter xviii in which phileas fogg passepartout and fix go each about his business
the weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage the wind obstinately remaining in the north-west blew a gale and retarded the steamer the rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path a sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of november the squall knocking the vessel about with fury and the waves running high the rangoon reefed all her sails and even the rigging proved too much whistling and shaking amid the squall the steamer was forced to proceed slowly and the captain estimated that she would reach hong kong twenty hours behind time and more if the storm lasted
phileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him with his habitual tranquillity he never changed countenance for an instant though a delay of twenty hours by making him too late for the yokohama boat would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme and had been foreseen aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him
fix did not look at the state of things in the same light the storm greatly pleased him his satisfaction would have been complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves each delay filled him with hope for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies with the gusts and squalls it mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience; and whilst his body was writhing under their effects his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation
passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather everything had gone so well till now earth and sea had seemed to be at his masters service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey had the hour of adversity come? passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket the storm exasperated him the gale made him furious and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience poor fellow fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction for had he betrayed it passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence
passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted being unable to remain quiet below and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew he overwhelmed the captain officers and sailors who could not help laughing at his impatience with all sorts of questions he wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last; whereupon he was referred to the barometer which seemed to have no intention of rising passepartout shook it but with no perceptible effect; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind
on the 4th however the sea became more calm and the storm lessened its violence; the wind veered southward and was once more favourable passepartout cleared up with the weather some of the sails were unfurled and the rangoon resumed its most rapid speed the time lost could not however be regained land was not signalled until five oclock on the morning of the 6th; the steamer was due on the 5th phileas fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand and the yokohama steamer would of course be missed
the pilot went on board at six and took his place on the bridge to guide the rangoon through the channels to the port of hong kong passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for yokohama; but he dared not for he wished to preserve the spark of hope which still remained till the last moment he had confided his anxiety to fix who--the sly rascal--tried to console him by saying that mr fogg would be in time if he took the next boat; but this only put passepartout in a passion
mr fogg bolder than his servant did not hesitate to approach the pilot and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave hong kong for yokohama
at high tide to-morrow morning answered the pilot
ah said mr fogg without betraying any astonishment
passepartout who heard what passed would willingly have embraced the pilot while fix would have been glad to twist his neck
what is the steamers name? asked mr fogg
the carnatic ought she not to have gone yesterday?
yes sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow
thank you returned mr fogg descending mathematically to the saloon
passepartout clasped the pilots hand and shook it heartily in his delight exclaiming pilot you are the best of good fellows
the pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting he remounted the bridge and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks tankas and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of hong kong
at one oclock the rangoon was at the quay and the passengers were going ashore
chance had strangely favoured phileas fogg for had not the carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers she would have left on the 6th of november and the passengers for japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer mr fogg was it is true twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour
the steamer which crossed the pacific from yokohama to san francisco made a direct connection with that from hong kong and it could not sail until the latter reached yokohama; and if mr fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching yokohama this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the pacific he found himself then about twenty-four hours behind-hand thirty-five days after leaving london
the carnatic was announced to leave hong kong at five the next morning mr fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there which was to deposit aouda safely with her wealthy relative
on landing he conducted her to a palanquin in which they repaired to the club hotel a room was engaged for the young woman and mr fogg after seeing that she wanted for nothing set out in search of her cousin jeejeeh he instructed passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return that aouda might not be left entirely alone
mr fogg repaired to the exchange where he did not doubt every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the parsee merchant meeting a broker he made the inquiry to learn that jeejeeh had left china two years before and retiring from business with an immense fortune had taken up his residence in europe--in holland the broker thought with the merchants of which country he had principally traded phileas fogg returned to the hotel begged a moments conversation with aouda and without more ado apprised her that jeejeeh was no longer at hong kong but probably in holland
aouda at first said nothing she passed her hand across her forehead and reflected a few moments then in her sweet soft voice she said: what ought i to do mr fogg?
it is very simple responded the gentleman go on to europe
but i cannot intrude-- you do not intrude nor do you in the least embarrass my project passepartout
monsieur go to the carnatic and engage three cabins
passepartout delighted that the young woman who was very gracious to him was going to continue the journey with them went off at a brisk gait to obey his masters order
chapter xix in which passepartout takes a too great interest in his master and what comes of it
hong kong is an island which came into the possession of the english by the treaty of nankin after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of the english has created upon it an important city and an excellent port the island is situated at the mouth of the canton river and is separated by about sixty miles from the portuguese town of macao on the opposite coast hong kong has beaten macao in the struggle for the chinese trade and now the greater part of the transportation of chinese goods finds its depot at the former place docks hospitals wharves a gothic cathedral a government house macadamised streets give to hong kong the appearance of a town in kent or surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes
passepartout wandered with his hands in his pockets towards the victoria port gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance and the groups of chinese japanese and europeans who passed to and fro in the streets hong kong seemed to him not unlike bombay calcutta and singapore since like them it betrayed everywhere the evidence of english supremacy at the victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: english french american and dutch men-of-war and trading vessels japanese and chinese junks sempas tankas and flower-boats which formed so many floating parterres passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow on going into a barbers to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old at which age they are permitted to wear yellow which is the imperial colour passepartout without exactly knowing why thought this very funny
on reaching the quay where they were to embark on the carnatic he was not astonished to find fix walking up and down the detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed
this is bad muttered passepartout for the gentlemen of the reform club he accosted fix with a merry smile as if he had not perceived that gentlemans chagrin the detective had indeed good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him the warrant had not come it was certainly on the way but as certainly it could not now reach hong kong for several days; and this being the last english territory on mr foggs route the robber would escape unless he could manage to detain him
well monsieur fix said passepartout have you decided to go with us so far as america?
yes returned fix through his set teeth
good exclaimed passepartout laughing heartily i knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us come and engage your berth
they entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons the clerk as he gave them the tickets informed them that the repairs on the carnatic having been completed the steamer would leave that very evening and not next morning as had been announced
that will suit my master all the better said passepartout i will go and let him know
fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell passepartout all it seemed to be the only possible means of keeping phileas fogg several days longer at hong kong he accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay on entering they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep at the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking english beer porter gin and brandy; smoking the while long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose from time to time one of the smokers overcome with the narcotic would slip under the table whereupon the waiters taking him by the head and feet carried and laid him upon the bed the bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots
fix and passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched cadaverous idiotic creatures to whom the english merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds--thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity the chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws it passed gradually from the rich to whom it was at first exclusively reserved to the lower classes and then its ravages could not be arrested opium is smoked everywhere at all times by men and women in the celestial empire; and once accustomed to it the victims cannot dispense with it except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies a great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years it was in one of these dens that fix and passepartout in search of a friendly glass found themselves passepartout had no money but willingly accepted fixs invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time
they ordered two bottles of port to which the frenchman did ample justice whilst fix observed him with close attention they chatted about the journey and passepartout was especially merry at the idea that fix was going to continue it with them when the bottles were empty however he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the carnatic
fix caught him by the arm and said wait a moment
what for mr fix? i want to have a serious talk with you
a serious talk cried passepartout drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass well well talk about it to-morrow; i havent time now
stay what i have to say concerns your master
passepartout at this looked attentively at his companion fixs face seemed to have a singular expression he resumed his seat
what is it that you have to say?
fix placed his hand upon passepartouts arm and lowering his voice said you have guessed who i am?
parbleu said passepartout smiling then im going to tell you everything--
now that i know everything my friend ah thats very good but go on go on first though let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense
useless said fix you speak confidently its clear that you dont know how large the sum is
of course i do returned passepartout twenty thousand pounds
fifty-five thousand answered fix pressing his companions hand
what cried the frenchman has monsieur fogg dared--fifty-five thousand pounds well theres all the more reason for not losing an instant he continued getting up hastily
fix pushed passepartout back in his chair and resumed: fifty-five thousand pounds; and if i succeed i get two thousand pounds if youll help me ill let you have five hundred of them
help you? cried passepartout whose eyes were standing wide open
yes; help me keep mr fogg here for two or three days
why what are you saying? those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour but they must try to put obstacles in his way i blush for them
what do you mean? i mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery they might as well waylay mr fogg and put his money in their pockets
thats just what we count on doing
its a conspiracy then cried passepartout who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head for he drank without perceiving it a real conspiracy and gentlemen too bah
fix began to be puzzled members of the reform club continued passepartout you must know monsieur fix that my master is an honest man and that when he makes a wager he tries to win it fairly
but who do you think i am? asked fix looking at him intently
parbleu an agent of the members of the reform club sent out here to interrupt my masters journey but though i found you out some time ago ive taken good care to say nothing about it to mr fogg
he knows nothing then? nothing replied passepartout again emptying his glass
the detective passed his hand across his forehead hesitating before he spoke again what should he do? passepartouts mistake seemed sincere but it made his design more difficult it was evident that the servant was not the masters accomplice as fix had been inclined to suspect
well said the detective to himself as he is not an accomplice he will help me
he had no time to lose: fogg must be detained at hong kong so he resolved to make a clean breast of it
listen to me said fix abruptly i am not as you think an agent of the members of the reform club--
bah retorted passepartout with an air of raillery
i am a police detective sent out here by the london office
you a detective? i will prove it here is my commission
passepartout was speechless with astonishment when fix displayed this document the genuineness of which could not be doubted
mr foggs wager resumed fix is only a pretext of which you and the gentlemen of the reform are dupes he had a motive for securing your innocent complicity
but why? listen on the 28th of last september a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the bank of england by a person whose description was fortunately secured here is his description; it answers exactly to that of mr phileas fogg
what nonsense cried passepartout striking the table with his fist my master is the most honourable of men
how can you tell? you know scarcely anything about him you went into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext without trunks and carrying a large amount in banknotes and yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man
yes yes repeated the poor fellow mechanically
would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?
passepartout overcome by what he had heard held his head between his hands and did not dare to look at the detective phileas fogg the saviour of aouda that brave and generous man a robber and yet how many presumptions there were against him passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty
well what do you want of me? said he at last with an effort
see here replied fix; i have tracked mr fogg to this place but as yet i have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which i sent to london you must help me to keep him here in hong kong--
i but i-- i will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the bank of england
never replied passepartout who tried to rise but fell back exhausted in mind and body
mr fix he stammered even should what you say be true--if my master is really the robber you are seeking for--which i deny--i have been am in his service; i have seen his generosity and goodness; and i will never betray him--not for all the gold in the world i come from a village where they dont eat that kind of bread
you refuse? i refuse consider that ive said nothing said fix; and let us drink
yes; let us drink passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor fix seeing that he must at all hazards be separated from his master wished to entirely overcome him some pipes full of opium lay upon the table fix slipped one into passepartouts hand he took it put it between his lips lit it drew several puffs and his head becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic fell upon the table
at last said fix seeing passepartout unconscious mr fogg will not be informed of the carnatics departure; and if he is he will have to go without this cursed frenchman
and after paying his bill fix left the tavern
chapter xx in which fix comes face to face with phileas fogg
while these events were passing at the opium-house mr fogg unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer was quietly escorting aouda about the streets of the english quarter making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them it was all very well for an englishman like mr fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions he acquitted his task with characteristic serenity and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion who was confused by his patience and generosity:
it is in the interest of my journey--a part of my programme
the purchases made they returned to the hotel where they dined at a sumptuously served table-dhote; after which aouda shaking hands with her protector after the english fashion retired to her room for rest mr fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of the times and illustrated london news
had he been capable of being astonished at anything it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime but knowing that the steamer was not to leave for yokohama until the next morning he did not disturb himself about the matter when passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his masters bell mr fogg not betraying the least vexation contented himself with taking his carpet-bag calling aouda and sending for a palanquin
it was then eight oclock; at half-past nine it being then high tide the carnatic would leave the harbour mr fogg and aouda got into the palanquin their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark mr fogg then learned that the carnatic had sailed the evening before he had expected to find not only the steamer but his domestic and was forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face and he merely remarked to aouda it is an accident madam; nothing more
at this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached it was fix who bowing addressed mr fogg: were you not like me sir a passenger by the rangoon which arrived yesterday?
i was sir replied mr fogg coldly but i have not the honour--
pardon me; i thought i should find your servant here
do you know where he is sir? asked aouda anxiously
what responded fix feigning surprise is he not with you?
no said aouda he has not made his appearance since yesterday could he have gone on board the carnatic without us?
without you madam? answered the detective excuse me did you intend to sail in the carnatic?
yes sir so did i madam and i am excessively disappointed the carnatic its repairs being completed left hong kong twelve hours before the stated time without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer
as he said a week fix felt his heart leap for joy fogg detained at hong kong for a week there would be time for the warrant to arrive and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law his horror may be imagined when he heard mr fogg say in his placid voice but there are other vessels besides the carnatic it seems to me in the harbour of hong kong
and offering his arm to aouda he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start fix stupefied followed; it seemed as if he were attached to mr fogg by an invisible thread chance however appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well for three hours phileas fogg wandered about the docks with the determination if necessary to charter a vessel to carry him to yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading and which could not therefore set sail fix began to hope again
but mr fogg far from being discouraged was continuing his search resolved not to stop if he had to resort to macao when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves
is your honour looking for a boat?
have you a boat ready to sail?
yes your honour; a pilot-boat--no 43--the best in the harbour
does she go fast? between eight and nine knots the hour will you look at her?
yes your honour will be satisfied with her is it for a sea excursion?
no; for a voyage a voyage?
yes will you agree to take me to yokohama?
the sailor leaned on the railing opened his eyes wide and said is your honour joking?
no i have missed the carnatic and i must get to yokohama by the 14th at the latest to take the boat for san francisco
i am sorry said the sailor; but it is impossible
i offer you a hundred pounds per day and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if i reach yokohama in time
are you in earnest? very much so
the pilot walked away a little distance and gazed out to sea evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far fix was in mortal suspense
mr fogg turned to aouda and asked her you would not be afraid would you madam?
not with you mr fogg was her answer
the pilot now returned shuffling his hat in his hands
well pilot? said mr fogg well your honour replied he i could not risk myself my men or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year besides we could not reach yokohama in time for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from hong kong
only sixteen hundred said mr fogg
its the same thing fix breathed more freely
but added the pilot it might be arranged another way
fix ceased to breathe at all
how? asked mr fogg by going to nagasaki at the extreme south of japan or even to shanghai which is only eight hundred miles from here in going to shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the chinese coast which would be a great advantage as the currents run northward and would aid us
pilot said mr fogg i must take the american steamer at yokohama and not at shanghai or nagasaki
why not? returned the pilot the san francisco steamer does not start from yokohama it puts in at yokohama and nagasaki but it starts from shanghai
you are sure of that? perfectly
and when does the boat leave shanghai?
on the 11th at seven in the evening we have therefore four days before us that is ninety-six hours; and in that time if we had good luck and a south-west wind and the sea was calm we could make those eight hundred miles to shanghai
and you could go-- in an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up
it is a bargain are you the master of the boat?
yes; john bunsby master of the tankadere
would you like some earnest-money? if it would not put your honour out--
here are two hundred pounds on account sir added phileas fogg turning to fix if you would like to take advantage--
thanks sir; i was about to ask the favour
very well in half an hour we shall go on board
but poor passepartout? urged aouda who was much disturbed by the servants disappearance
i shall do all i can to find him replied phileas fogg
while fix in a feverish nervous state repaired to the pilot-boat the others directed their course to the police-station at hong kong phileas fogg there gave passepartouts description and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him the same formalities having been gone through at the french consulate and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage which had been sent back there they returned to the wharf
it was now three oclock; and pilot-boat no 43 with its crew on board and its provisions stored away was ready for departure
the tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht her shining copper sheathing her galvanised iron-work her deck white as ivory betrayed the pride taken by john bunsby in making her presentable her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine foresail storm-jib and standing-jib and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed which indeed she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races the crew of the tankadere was composed of john bunsby the master and four hardy mariners who were familiar with the chinese seas john bunsby himself a man of forty-five or thereabouts vigorous sunburnt with a sprightly expression of the eye and energetic and self-reliant countenance would have inspired confidence in the most timid
phileas fogg and aouda went on board where they found fix already installed below deck was a square cabin of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp the accommodation was confined but neat
i am sorry to have nothing better to offer you said mr fogg to fix who bowed without responding
the detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of mr fogg
its certain thought he though rascal as he is he is a polite one
the sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three mr fogg and aouda who were seated on deck cast a last glance at the quay in the hope of espying passepartout fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant whom he had so badly treated in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued but the frenchman did not appear and without doubt was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium
john bunsby master at length gave the order to start and the tankadere taking the wind under her brigantine foresail and standing-jib bounded briskly forward over the waves
chapter xxi in which the master of the tankadere runs great risk of losing a reward of two hundred pounds
this voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons and at that season of the year the chinese seas are usually boisterous subject to terrible gales of wind and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early november
it would clearly have been to the masters advantage to carry his passengers to yokohama since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach shanghai but john bunsby believed in the tankadere which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong
late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of hong kong and the tankadere impelled by favourable winds conducted herself admirably
i do not need pilot said phileas fogg when they got into the open sea to advise you to use all possible speed
trust me your honour we are carrying all the sail the wind will let us the poles would add nothing and are only used when we are going into port
its your trade not mine pilot and i confide in you
phileas fogg with body erect and legs wide apart standing like a sailor gazed without staggering at the swelling waters the young woman who was seated aft was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean darkening now with the twilight on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel above her head rustled the white sails which seemed like great white wings the boat carried forward by the wind seemed to be flying in the air
night came the moon was entering her first quarter and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon clouds were rising from the east and already overcast a part of the heavens
the pilot had hung out his lights which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences and at the speed she was going the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft
fix seated in the bow gave himself up to meditation he kept apart from his fellow-travellers knowing mr foggs taciturn tastes; besides he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted he was thinking too of the future it seemed certain that fogg would not stop at yokohama but would at once take the boat for san francisco; and the vast extent of america would ensure him impunity and safety foggs plan appeared to him the simplest in the world instead of sailing directly from england to the united states like a common villain he had traversed three quarters of the globe so as to gain the american continent more surely; and there after throwing the police off his track he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank but once in the united states what should he fix do? should he abandon this man? no a hundred times no until he had secured his extradition he would not lose sight of him for an hour it was his duty and he would fulfil it to the end at all events there was one thing to be thankful for; passepartout was not with his master; and it was above all important after the confidences fix had imparted to him that the servant should never have speech with his master
phileas fogg was also thinking of passepartout who had so strangely disappeared looking at the matter from every point of view it did not seem to him impossible that by some mistake the man might have embarked on the carnatic at the last moment; and this was also aoudas opinion who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much they might then find him at yokohama; for if the carnatic was carrying him thither it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board
a brisk breeze arose about ten oclock; but though it might have been prudent to take in a reef the pilot after carefully examining the heavens let the craft remain rigged as before the tankadere bore sail admirably as she drew a great deal of water and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale
mr fogg and aouda descended into the cabin at midnight having been already preceded by fix who had lain down on one of the cots the pilot and crew remained on deck all night
at sunrise the next day which was 8th november the boat had made more than one hundred miles the log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles the tankadere still carried all sail and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed if the wind held as it was the chances would be in her favour during the day she kept along the coast where the currents were favourable; the coast irregular in profile and visible sometimes across the clearings was at most five miles distant the sea was less boisterous since the wind came off land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat which would suffer owing to its small tonnage by a heavy surge on the sea
the breeze subsided a little towards noon and set in from the south-west the pilot put up his poles but took them down again within two hours as the wind freshened up anew
mr fogg and aouda happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea ate with a good appetite fix being invited to share their repast which he accepted with secret chagrin to travel at this mans expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him still he was obliged to eat and so he ate
when the meal was over he took mr fogg apart and said sir--this sir scorched his lips and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this gentleman--sir you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat but though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you i must ask to pay my share--
let us not speak of that sir replied mr fogg
but if i insist-- no sir repeated mr fogg in a tone which did not admit of a reply this enters into my general expenses
fix as he bowed had a stifled feeling and going forward where he ensconced himself did not open his mouth for the rest of the day
meanwhile they were progressing famously and john bunsby was in high hope he several times assured mr fogg that they would reach shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it the crew set to work in good earnest inspired by the reward to be gained there was not a sheet which was not tightened not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm they worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a royal yacht regatta
by evening the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from hong kong and mr fogg might hope that he would be able to reach yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in which case the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left london would not seriously affect his journey
the tankadere entered the straits of fo-kien which separate the island of formosa from the chinese coast in the small hours of the night and crossed the tropic of cancer the sea was very rough in the straits full of eddies formed by the counter-currents and the chopping waves broke her course whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck
at daybreak the wind began to blow hard again and the heavens seemed to predict a gale the barometer announced a speedy change the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also in the south-east raised long surges which indicated a tempest the sun had set the evening before in a red mist in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean
john bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens muttering indistinctly between his teeth at last he said in a low voice to mr fogg shall i speak out to your honour?
of course well we are going to have a squall
is the wind north or south? asked mr fogg quietly
south look a typhoon is coming up
glad its a typhoon from the south for it will carry us forward
oh if you take it that way said john bunsby ive nothing more to say john bunsbys suspicions were confirmed at a less advanced season of the year the typhoon according to a famous meteorologist would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence
the pilot took his precautions in advance he reefed all sail the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows a single triangular sail of strong canvas was hoisted as a storm-jib so as to hold the wind from behind then they waited
john bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space with little air and the boat bouncing in the gale was far from pleasant neither mr fogg fix nor aouda consented to leave the deck
the storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight oclock with but its bit of sail the tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given to compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth
the boat scudded thus northward during the whole day borne on by monstrous waves preserving always fortunately a speed equal to theirs twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her the passengers were often bathed in spray but they submitted to it philosophically fix cursed it no doubt; but aouda with her eyes fastened upon her protector whose coolness amazed her showed herself worthy of him and bravely weathered the storm as for phileas fogg it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme
up to this time the tankadere had always held her course to the north; but towards evening the wind veering three quarters bore down from the north-west the boat now lying in the trough of the waves shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence at night the tempest increased in violence john bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings he thought awhile and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed after a consultation he approached mr fogg and said i think your honour that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast
i think so too ah said the pilot but which one?
i know of but one returned mr fogg tranquilly
and that is-- shanghai the pilot at first did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity then he cried well--yes your honour is right to shanghai
so the tankadere kept steadily on her northward track
the night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did not founder twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch aouda was exhausted but did not utter a complaint more than once mr fogg rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves
day reappeared the tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the wind now returned to the south-east it was a favourable change and the tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea though the waves crossed each other and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built from time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist but no vessel was in sight the tankadere was alone upon the sea
there were some signs of a calm at noon and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon the tempest had been as brief as terrific the passengers thoroughly exhausted could now eat a little and take some repose
the night was comparatively quiet some of the sails were again hoisted and the speed of the boat was very good the next morning at dawn they espied the coast and john bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from shanghai a hundred miles and only one day to traverse them that very evening mr fogg was due at shanghai if he did not wish to miss the steamer to yokohama had there been no storm during which several hours were lost they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination
the wind grew decidedly calmer and happily the sea fell with it all sails were now hoisted and at noon the tankadere was within forty-five miles of shanghai there remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance all on board feared that it could not be done and every one--phileas fogg no doubt excepted--felt his heart beat with impatience the boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour and the wind was becoming calmer every moment it was a capricious breeze coming from the coast and after it passed the sea became smooth still the tankadere was so light and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well that with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six oclock not more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream at seven they were still three miles from shanghai the pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him he looked at mr fogg mr fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake
at this moment also a long black funnel crowned with wreaths of smoke appeared on the edge of the waters it was the american steamer leaving for yokohama at the appointed time
confound her cried john bunsby pushing back the rudder with a desperate jerk
signal her said phileas fogg quietly
a small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the tankadere for making signals in the fogs it was loaded to the muzzle; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole mr fogg said hoist your flag
the flag was run up at half-mast and this being the signal of distress it was hoped that the american steamer perceiving it would change her course a little so as to succour the pilot-boat
fire said mr fogg and the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air
chapter xxii in which passepartout finds out that even at the antipodes it is convenient to have some money in ones pocket
the carnatic setting sail from hong kong at half-past six on the 7th of november directed her course at full steam towards japan she carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers two state-rooms in the rear were however unoccupied--those which had been engaged by phileas fogg
the next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye staggering gait and disordered hair was seen to emerge from the second cabin and to totter to a seat on deck
it was passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows: shortly after fix left the opium den two waiters had lifted the unconscious passepartout and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers three hours later pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea the poor fellow awoke and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic the thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls falling down and creeping up again and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct he kept crying out the carnatic the carnatic
the steamer lay puffing alongside the quay on the point of starting passepartout had but few steps to go; and rushing upon the plank he crossed it and fell unconscious on the deck just as the carnatic was moving off several sailors who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene carried the poor frenchman down into the second cabin and passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from china thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the carnatic and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze the pure air sobered him he began to collect his sense which he found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before fixs revelation and the opium-house
it is evident said he to himself that i have been abominably drunk what will mr fogg say? at least i have not missed the steamer which is the most important thing
then as fix occurred to him: as for that rascal i hope we are well rid of him and that he has not dared as he proposed to follow us on board the carnatic a detective on the track of mr fogg accused of robbing the bank of england pshaw mr fogg is no more a robber than i am a murderer
should he divulge fixs real errand to his master? would it do to tell the part the detective was playing? would it not be better to wait until mr fogg reached london again and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world and have a good laugh over it? no doubt; at least it was worth considering the first thing to do was to find mr fogg and apologise for his singular behaviour
passepartout got up and proceeded as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer to the after-deck he saw no one who resembled either his master or aouda good muttered he; aouda has not got up yet and mr fogg has probably found some partners at whist
he descended to the saloon mr fogg was not there passepartout had only however to ask the purser the number of his masters state-room the purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of fogg
i beg your pardon said passepartout persistently he is a tall gentleman quiet and not very talkative and has with him a young lady--
there is no young lady on board interrupted the purser here is a list of the passengers; you may see for yourself
passepartout scanned the list but his masters name was not upon it all at once an idea struck him
ah am i on the carnatic?
yes on the way to yokohama?
certainly passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat; but though he was really on the carnatic his master was not there
he fell thunderstruck on a seat he saw it all now he remembered that the time of sailing had been changed that he should have informed his master of that fact and that he had not done so it was his fault then that mr fogg and aouda had missed the steamer yes but it was still more the fault of the traitor who in order to separate him from his master and detain the latter at hong kong had inveigled him into getting drunk he now saw the detectives trick; and at this moment mr fogg was certainly ruined his bet was lost and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned at this thought passepartout tore his hair ah if fix ever came within his reach what a settling of accounts there would be
after his first depression passepartout became calmer and began to study his situation it was certainly not an enviable one he found himself on the way to japan and what should he do when he got there? his pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling not so much as a penny his passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course he fell to at meals with an appetite and ate for mr fogg aouda and himself he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desert where nothing to eat was to be looked for
at dawn on the 13th the carnatic entered the port of yokohama this is an important port of call in the pacific where all the mail-steamers and those carrying travellers between north america china japan and the oriental islands put in it is situated in the bay of yeddo and at but a short distance from that second capital of the japanese empire and the residence of the tycoon the civil emperor before the mikado the spiritual emperor absorbed his office in his own the carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations
passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the sons of the sun he had nothing better to do than taking chance for his guide to wander aimlessly through the streets of yokohama he found himself at first in a thoroughly european quarter the houses having low fronts and being adorned with verandas beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles this quarter occupied with its streets squares docks and warehouses all the space between the promontory of the treaty and the river here as at hong kong and calcutta were mixed crowds of all races americans and english chinamen and dutchmen mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything the frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of hottentots
he had at least one resource--to call on the french and english consuls at yokohama for assistance but he shrank from telling the story of his adventures intimately connected as it was with that of his master; and before doing so he determined to exhaust all other means of aid as chance did not favour him in the european quarter he penetrated that inhabited by the native japanese determined if necessary to push on to yeddo
the japanese quarter of yokohama is called benten after the goddess of the sea who is worshipped on the islands round about there passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves sacred gates of a singular architecture bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds temples shaded by immense cedar-trees holy retreats where were sheltered buddhist priests and sectaries of confucius and interminable streets where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children who looked as if they had been cut out of japanese screens and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats might have been gathered
the streets were crowded with people priests were passing in processions beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists; soldiers clad in blue cotton with white stripes and bearing guns; the mikados guards enveloped in silken doubles hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all ranks--for the military profession is as much respected in japan as it is despised in china--went hither and thither in groups and pairs passepartout saw too begging friars long-robed pilgrims and simple civilians with their warped and jet-black hair big heads long busts slender legs short stature and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white but never yellow like the chinese from whom the japanese widely differ he did not fail to observe the curious equipages--carriages and palanquins barrows supplied with sails and litters made of bamboo; nor the women--whom he thought not especially handsome--who took little steps with their little feet whereon they wore canvas shoes straw sandals and clogs of worked wood and who displayed tight-looking eyes flat chests teeth fashionably blackened and gowns crossed with silken scarfs tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of japan
passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint japanese ornaments the restaurants decked with streamers and banners the tea-houses where the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice and the comfortable smoking-houses where they were puffing not opium which is almost unknown in japan but a very fine stringy tobacco he went on till he found himself in the fields in the midst of vast rice plantations there he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes not on bushes but on trees and within bamboo enclosures cherry plum and apple trees which the japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit and which queerly-fashioned grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows pigeons ravens and other voracious birds on the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows ducks hawks wild birds and a multitude of cranes which the japanese consider sacred and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity
as he was strolling along passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs
good said he; ill have some supper
but on smelling them he found that they were odourless
no chance there thought he the worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnatic; but as he had been walking about all day the demands of hunger were becoming importunate he observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton goat nor pork; and knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle which are preserved solely for farming he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohama--nor was he mistaken; and in default of butchers meat he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer a partridge or some quails some game or fish which with rice the japanese eat almost exclusively but he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning night came and passepartout re-entered the native quarter where he wandered through the streets lit by vari-coloured lanterns looking on at the dancers who were executing skilful steps and boundings and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes then he came to the harbour which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen who were fishing from their boats
the streets at last became quiet and the patrol the officers of which in their splendid costumes and surrounded by their suites passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors succeeded the bustling crowd each time a company passed passepartout chuckled and said to himself: good another japanese embassy departing for europe
chapter xxiii in which passepartouts nose becomes outrageously long
the next morning poor jaded famished passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards and the sooner he did so the better he might indeed sell his watch; but he would have starved first now or never he must use the strong if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him he knew several french and english songs and resolved to try them upon the japanese who must be lovers of music since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals tam-tams and tambourines and could not but appreciate european talent
it was perhaps rather early in the morning to get up a concert and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the mikados features passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and as he was sauntering along it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist the idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger the resolution taken it remained to carry it out
it was only after a long search that passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes to whom he applied for an exchange the man liked the european costume and ere long passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old japanese coat and a sort of one-sided turban faded with long use a few small pieces of silver moreover jingled in his pocket
good thought he i will imagine i am at the carnival
his first care after being thus japanesed was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance and upon half a bird and a little rice to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved
now thought he when he had eaten heartily i mustnt lose my head i cant sell this costume again for one still more japanese i must consider how to leave this country of the sun of which i shall not retain the most delightful of memories as quickly as possible
it occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for america he would offer himself as a cook or servant in payment of his passage and meals once at san francisco he would find some means of going on the difficulty was how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the pacific which lay between japan and the new world
passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging and directed his steps towards the docks but as he approached them his project which at first had seemed so simple began to grow more and more formidable to his mind what need would they have of a cook or servant on an american steamer and what confidence would they put in him dressed as he was? what references could he give?
as he was reflecting in this wise his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets this placard which was in english read as follows:
acrobatic japanese troupe honourable william batulcar proprietor last representations prior to their departure to the united states of the long noses long noses under the direct patronage of the god tingou great attraction
the united states said passepartout; thats just what i want
he followed the clown and soon found himself once more in the japanese quarter a quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin adorned with several clusters of streamers the exterior walls of which were designed to represent in violent colours and without perspective a company of jugglers
this was the honourable william batulcars establishment that gentleman was a sort of barnum the director of a troupe of mountebanks jugglers clowns acrobats equilibrists and gymnasts who according to the placard was giving his last performances before leaving the empire of the sun for the states of the union
passepartout entered and asked for mr batulcar who straightway appeared in person
what do you want? said he to passepartout whom he at first took for a native
would you like a servant sir? asked passepartout
a servant cried mr batulcar caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin i already have two who are obedient and faithful have never left me and serve me for their nourishment and here they are added he holding out his two robust arms furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol
so i can be of no use to you?
none the devil i should so like to cross the pacific with you
ah said the honourable mr batulcar you are no more a japanese than i am a monkey who are you dressed up in that way?
a man dresses as he can
thats true you are a frenchman arent you?
yes; a parisian of paris then you ought to know how to make grimaces?
why replied passepartout a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question we frenchmen know how to make grimaces it is true but not any better than the americans do
true well if i cant take you as a servant i can as a clown you see my friend in france they exhibit foreign clowns and in foreign parts french clowns
ah you are pretty strong eh?
especially after a good meal and you can sing?
yes returned passepartout who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets
but can you sing standing on your head with a top spinning on your left foot and a sabre balanced on your right?
humph i think so replied passepartout recalling the exercises of his younger days
well thats enough said the honourable william batulcar
the engagement was concluded there and then
passepartout had at last found something to do he was engaged to act in the celebrated japanese troupe it was not a very dignified position but within a week he would be on his way to san francisco
the performance so noisily announced by the honourable mr batulcar was to commence at three oclock and soon the deafening instruments of a japanese orchestra resounded at the door passepartout though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the human pyramid executed by the long noses of the god tingou this great attraction was to close the performance
before three oclock the large shed was invaded by the spectators comprising europeans and natives chinese and japanese men women and children who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage the musicians took up a position inside and were vigorously performing on their gongs tam-tams flutes bones tambourines and immense drums
the performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the japanese are the first equilibrists in the world
one with a fan and some bits of paper performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air with the odorous smoke of his pipe a series of blue words which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems the edges of sabres wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses crossed bamboo ladders dispersed into all the corners and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone the jugglers tossed them in the air threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets and took them out still whirling as before
it is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts the turning on ladders poles balls barrels &c was executed with wonderful precision
but the principal attraction was the exhibition of the long noses a show to which europe is as yet a stranger
the long noses form a peculiar company under the direct patronage of the god tingou attired after the fashion of the middle ages they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces and the uses which they made of them these noses were made of bamboo and were five six and even ten feet long some straight others curved some ribboned and some having imitation warts upon them it was upon these appendages fixed tightly on their real noses that they performed their gymnastic exercises a dozen of these sectaries of tingou lay flat upon their backs while others dressed to represent lightning-rods came and frolicked on their noses jumping from one to another and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults
as a last scene a human pyramid had been announced in which fifty long noses were to represent the car of juggernaut but instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each others shoulders the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses it happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the car had quitted the troupe and as to fill this part only strength and adroitness were necessary passepartout had been chosen to take his place
the poor fellow really felt sad when--melancholy reminiscence of his youth--he donned his costume adorned with vari-coloured wings and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long but he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat
he went upon the stage and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the car of juggernaut they all stretched themselves on the floor their noses pointing to the ceiling a second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages then a third above these then a fourth until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses this elicited loud applause in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air when the pyramid tottered the balance was lost one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards
it was passepartouts fault abandoning his position clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings and clambering up to the right-hand gallery he fell at the feet of one of the spectators crying ah my master my master
you here? myself very well; then let us go to the steamer young man
mr fogg aouda and passepartout passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside where they encountered the honourable mr batulcar furious with rage he demanded damages for the breakage of the pyramid; and phileas fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes
at half-past six the very hour of departure mr fogg and aouda followed by passepartout who in his hurry had retained his wings and nose six feet long stepped upon the american steamer
chapter xxiv during which mr fogg and party cross the pacific ocean
what happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of shanghai will be easily guessed the signals made by the tankadere had been seen by the captain of the yokohama steamer who espying the flag at half-mast had directed his course towards the little craft phileas fogg after paying the stipulated price of his passage to john busby and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds ascended the steamer with aouda and fix; and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohama
they reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of november phileas fogg lost no time in going on board the carnatic where he learned to aoudas great delight--and perhaps to his own though he betrayed no emotion--that passepartout a frenchman had really arrived on her the day before
the san francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening and it became necessary to find passepartout if possible without delay mr fogg applied in vain to the french and english consuls and after wandering through the streets a long time began to despair of finding his missing servant chance or perhaps a kind of presentiment at last led him into the honourable mr batulcars theatre he certainly would not have recognised passepartout in the eccentric mountebanks costume; but the latter lying on his back perceived his master in the gallery he could not help starting which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the pyramid pell-mell upon the stage
all this passepartout learned from aouda who recounted to him what had taken place on the voyage from hong kong to shanghai on the tankadere in company with one mr fix
passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name he thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself; and in the account he gave of his absence he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness in smoking opium at a tavern in hong kong
mr fogg heard this narrative coldly without a word; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position within an hour the frenchman had cut off his nose and parted with his wings and retained nothing about him which recalled the sectary of the god tingou
the steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san francisco belonged to the pacific mail steamship company and was named the general grant she was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast the massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles the general grant was rigged with three masts giving a large capacity for sails and thus materially aiding the steam power by making twelve miles an hour she would cross the ocean in twenty-one days phileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach san francisco by the 2nd of december new york by the 11th and london on the 20th--thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of december
there was a full complement of passengers on board among them english many americans a large number of coolies on their way to california and several east indian officers who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world nothing of moment happened on the voyage; the steamer sustained on its large paddles rolled but little and the pacific almost justified its name mr fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever his young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector aouda took the keenest interest in his plans and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey
she often chatted with passepartout who did not fail to perceive the state of the ladys heart; and being the most faithful of domestics he never exhausted his eulogies of phileas foggs honesty generosity and devotion he took pains to calm aoudas doubts of a successful termination of the journey telling her that the most difficult part of it had passed that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of japan and china and were fairly on their way to civilised places again a railway train from san francisco to new york and a transatlantic steamer from new york to liverpool would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon
on the ninth day after leaving yokohama phileas fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe the general grant passed on the 23rd of november the one hundred and eightieth meridian and was at the very antipodes of london mr fogg had it is true exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour and there were only twenty-eight left but though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from london to aden from aden to bombay from calcutta to singapore and from singapore to yokohama could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel which is that of london the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced by the irregular methods of locomotion to traverse twenty-six thousand of which he had on the 23rd of november accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred and now the course was a straight one and fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way
it happened also on the 23rd of november that passepartout made a joyful discovery it will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at london time and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable now on this day though he had not changed the hands he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ships chronometers his triumph was hilarious he would have liked to know what fix would say if he were aboard
the rogue told me a lot of stories repeated passepartout about the meridians the sun and the moon moon indeed moonshine more likely if one listened to that sort of people a pretty sort of time one would keep i was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch
passepartout was ignorant that if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours like the italian clocks he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then instead of as now indicating nine oclock in the morning indicate nine oclock in the evening that is the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between london time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian but if fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect passepartout would not have admitted even if he had comprehended it moreover if the detective had been on board at that moment passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject and in an entirely different manner
where was fix at that moment?
he was actually on board the general grant
on reaching yokohama the detective leaving mr fogg whom he expected to meet again during the day had repaired at once to the english consulate where he at last found the warrant of arrest it had followed him from bombay and had come by the carnatic on which steamer he himself was supposed to be fixs disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless mr fogg had left english ground and it was now necessary to procure his extradition
well thought fix after a moment of anger my warrant is not good here but it will be in england the rogue evidently intends to return to his own country thinking he has thrown the police off his track good i will follow him across the atlantic as for the money heaven grant there may be some left but the fellow has already spent in travelling rewards trials bail elephants and all sorts of charges more than five thousand pounds yet after all the bank is rich
his course decided on he went on board the general grant and was there when mr fogg and aouda arrived to his utter amazement he recognised passepartout despite his theatrical disguise he quickly concealed himself in his cabin to avoid an awkward explanation and hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by mr foggs servant
on that very day however he met passepartout face to face on the forward deck the latter without a word made a rush for him grasped him by the throat and much to the amusement of a group of americans who immediately began to bet on him administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows which proved the great superiority of french over english pugilistic skill
when passepartout had finished he found himself relieved and comforted fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition and looking at his adversary coldly said have you done?
for this time--yes then let me have a word with you
but i-- in your masters interests
passepartout seemed to be vanquished by fixs coolness for he quietly followed him and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers
you have given me a thrashing said fix good i expected it now listen to me up to this time i have been mr foggs adversary i am now in his game
aha cried passepartout; you are convinced he is an honest man?
no replied fix coldly i think him a rascal sh dont budge and let me speak as long as mr fogg was on english ground it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived i did everything i could to keep him back i sent the bombay priests after him i got you intoxicated at hong kong i separated you from him and i made him miss the yokohama steamer
passepartout listened with closed fists now resumed fix mr fogg seems to be going back to england well i will follow him there but hereafter i will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as i have done up to this time to put them in his path ive changed my game you see and simply because it was for my interest to change it your interest is the same as mine; for it is only in england that you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminal or an honest man
passepartout listened very attentively to fix and was convinced that he spoke with entire good faith
are we friends? asked the detective
friends?--no replied passepartout; but allies perhaps at the least sign of treason however ill twist your neck for you
agreed said the detective quietly eleven days later on the 3rd of december the general grant entered the bay of the golden gate and reached san francisco
mr fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day
chapter xxv in which a slight glimpse is had of san francisco
it was seven in the morning when mr fogg aouda and passepartout set foot upon the american continent if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked these quays rising and falling with the tide thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels alongside them were clippers of all sizes steamers of all nationalities and the steamboats with several decks rising one above the other which ply on the sacramento and its tributaries there were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to mexico chili peru brazil europe asia and all the pacific islands
passepartout in his joy on reaching at last the american continent thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style; but tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks he fell through them put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus set foot upon the new world he uttered a loud cry which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays that they flew noisily away
mr fogg on reaching shore proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for new york and learned that this was at six oclock pm; he had therefore an entire day to spend in the californian capital taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars he and aouda entered it while passepartout mounted the box beside the driver and they set out for the international hotel
from his exalted position passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets the low evenly ranged houses the anglo-saxon gothic churches the great docks the palatial wooden and brick warehouses the numerous conveyances omnibuses horse-cars and upon the side-walks not only americans and europeans but chinese and indians passepartout was surprised at all he saw san francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti assassins and incendiaries who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws where they gambled with gold-dust a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium
the lofty tower of its city hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues which cut each other at right-angles and in the midst of which appeared pleasant verdant squares while beyond appeared the chinese quarter seemingly imported from the celestial empire in a toy-box sombreros and red shirts and plumed indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active gentlemanly-looking men some of the streets--especially montgomery street which is to san francisco what regent street is to london the boulevard des italiens to paris and broadway to new york--were lined with splendid and spacious stores which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world
when passepartout reached the international hotel it did not seem to him as if he had left england at all
the ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by who might partake of dried beef oyster soup biscuits and cheese without taking out their purses payment was made only for the ale porter or sherry which was drunk this seemed very american to passepartout the hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable and mr fogg and aouda installing themselves at a table were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue
after breakfast mr fogg accompanied by aouda started for the english consulate to have his passport visaed as he was going out he met passepartout who asked him if it would not be well before taking the train to purchase some dozens of enfield rifles and colts revolvers he had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the sioux and pawnees mr fogg thought it a useless precaution but told him to do as he thought best and went on to the consulate
he had not proceeded two hundred steps however when by the greatest chance in the world he met fix the detective seemed wholly taken by surprise what had mr fogg and himself crossed the pacific together and not met on the steamer at least fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much and as his business recalled him to europe he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company
mr fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective--who was determined not to lose sight of him--begged permission to accompany them in their walk about san francisco--a request which mr fogg readily granted
they soon found themselves in montgomery street where a great crowd was collected; the side-walks street horsecar rails the shop-doors the windows of the houses and even the roofs were full of people men were going about carrying large posters and flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand
hurrah for camerfield hurrah for mandiboy
it was a political meeting; at least so fix conjectured who said to mr fogg perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd there may be danger in it
yes returned mr fogg; and blows even if they are political are still blows
fix smiled at this remark; and in order to be able to see without being jostled about the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of montgomery street opposite them on the other side of the street between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse a large platform had been erected in the open air towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed
for what purpose was this meeting? what was the occasion of this excited assemblage? phileas fogg could not imagine was it to nominate some high official--a governor or member of congress? it was not improbable so agitated was the multitude before them
just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass all the hands were raised in the air some tightly closed seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries--an energetic way no doubt of casting a vote the crowd swayed back the banners and flags wavered disappeared an instant then reappeared in tatters the undulations of the human surge reached the steps while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall many of the black hats disappeared and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height
it is evidently a meeting said fix and its object must be an exciting one i should not wonder if it were about the alabama despite the fact that that question is settled
perhaps replied mr fogg simply at least there are two champions in presence of each other the honourable mr camerfield and the honourable mr mandiboy
aouda leaning upon mr foggs arm observed the tumultuous scene with surprise while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was before the man could reply a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd boots and shoes went whirling through the air and mr fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din the rout approached the stairway and flowed over the lower step one of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfield had gained the upper hand
it would be prudent for us to retire said fix who was anxious that mr fogg should not receive any injury at least until they got back to london if there is any question about england in all this and we were recognised i fear it would go hard with us
an english subject-- began mr fogg
he did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood and there were frantic shouts of hurrah for mandiboy hip hip hurrah
it was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies and taking the camerfield forces in flank mr fogg aouda and fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape the torrent of men armed with loaded canes and sticks was irresistible phileas fogg and fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion; the former as cool as ever tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every englishmans arm but in vain a big brawny fellow with a red beard flushed face and broad shoulders who seemed to be the chief of the band raised his clenched fist to strike mr fogg whom he would have given a crushing blow had not fix rushed in and received it in his stead an enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detectives silk hat which was completely smashed in
yankee exclaimed mr fogg darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian
englishman returned the other we will meet again
when you please what is your name?
phileas fogg and yours? colonel stamp proctor
the human tide now swept by after overturning fix who speedily got upon his feet again though with tattered clothes happily he was not seriously hurt his travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts and his trousers resembled those of certain indians which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on aouda had escaped unharmed and fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise
thanks said mr fogg to the detective as soon as they were out of the crowd
no thanks are necessary replied fix; but let us go
where? to a tailors such a visit was indeed opportune the clothing of both mr fogg and fix was in rags as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between camerfield and mandiboy an hour after they were once more suitably attired and with aouda returned to the international hotel
passepartout was waiting for his master armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers when he perceived fix he knit his brows; but aouda having in a few words told him of their adventure his countenance resumed its placid expression fix evidently was no longer an enemy but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word
dinner over the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door as he was getting in mr fogg said to fix you have not seen this colonel proctor again?
no i will come back to america to find him said phileas fogg calmly it would not be right for an englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way without retaliating
the detective smiled but did not reply it was clear that mr fogg was one of those englishmen who while they do not tolerate duelling at home fight abroad when their honour is attacked
at a quarter before six the travellers reached the station and found the train ready to depart as he was about to enter it mr fogg called a porter and said to him: my friend was there not some trouble to-day in san francisco?
it was a political meeting sir replied the porter
but i thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets
it was only a meeting assembled for an election
the election of a general-in-chief no doubt? asked mr fogg
no sir; of a justice of the peace
phileas fogg got into the train which started off at full speed
chapter xxvi in which phileas fogg and party travel by the pacific railroad
from ocean to ocean--so say the americans; and these four words compose the general designation of the great trunk line which crosses the entire width of the united states the pacific railroad is however really divided into two distinct lines: the central pacific between san francisco and ogden and the union pacific between ogden and omaha five main lines connect omaha with new york
new york and san francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles between omaha and the pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by indians and wild beasts and a large tract which the mormons after they were driven from illinois in 1845 began to colonise
the journey from new york to san francisco consumed formerly under the most favourable conditions at least six months it is now accomplished in seven days
it was in 1862 that in spite of the southern members of congress who wished a more southerly route it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels president lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at omaha in nebraska the work was at once commenced and pursued with true american energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution the road grew on the prairies a mile and a half a day a locomotive running on the rails laid down the evening before brought the rails to be laid on the morrow and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position
the pacific railroad is joined by several branches in iowa kansas colorado and oregon on leaving omaha it passes along the left bank of the platte river as far as the junction of its northern branch follows its southern branch crosses the laramie territory and the wahsatch mountains turns the great salt lake and reaches salt lake city the mormon capital plunges into the tuilla valley across the american desert cedar and humboldt mountains the sierra nevada and descends via sacramento to the pacific--its grade even on the rocky mountains never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile
such was the road to be traversed in seven days which would enable phileas fogg--at least so he hoped--to take the atlantic steamer at new york on the 11th for liverpool
the car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels and with no compartments in the interior it was supplied with two rows of seats perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms these platforms were found throughout the train and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the other it was supplied with saloon cars balcony cars restaurants and smoking-cars; theatre cars alone were wanting and they will have these some day
book and news dealers sellers of edibles drinkables and cigars who seemed to have plenty of customers were continually circulating in the aisles
the train left oakland station at six oclock it was already night cold and cheerless the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed to threaten snow the train did not proceed rapidly; counting the stoppages it did not run more than twenty miles an hour which was a sufficient speed however to enable it to reach omaha within its designated time
there was but little conversation in the car and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep passepartout found himself beside the detective; but he did not talk to him after recent events their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them fixs manner had not changed; but passepartout was very reserved and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation
snow began to fall an hour after they started a fine snow however which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast white sheet against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect
at eight oclock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory the backs of the seats were thrown back bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system berths were suddenly improvised and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed protected from curious eyes by thick curtains the sheets were clean and the pillows soft it only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did--while the train sped on across the state of california
the country between san francisco and sacramento is not very hilly the central pacific taking sacramento for its starting-point extends eastward to meet the road from omaha the line from san francisco to sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction along the american river which empties into san pablo bay the one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours and towards midnight while fast asleep the travellers passed through sacramento; so that they saw nothing of that important place the seat of the state government with its fine quays its broad streets its noble hotels squares and churches
the train on leaving sacramento and passing the junction roclin auburn and colfax entered the range of the sierra nevada cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming the railway track wound in and out among the passes now approaching the mountain-sides now suspended over precipices avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves plunging into narrow defiles which seemed to have no outlet the locomotive its great funnel emitting a weird light with its sharp bell and its cow-catcher extended like a spur mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines
there were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route the railway turned around the sides of the mountains and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another
the train entered the state of nevada through the carson valley about nine oclock going always northeasterly; and at midday reached reno where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast
from this point the road running along humboldt river passed northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward and kept by the river until it reached the humboldt range nearly at the extreme eastern limit of nevada
having breakfasted mr fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies the mountains lining the horizon and the creeks with their frothy foaming streams sometimes a great herd of buffaloes massing together in the distance seemed like a moveable dam these innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together in compact ranks the locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear
this happened indeed to the train in which mr fogg was travelling about twelve oclock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track the locomotive slackening its speed tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great the buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait uttering now and then deafening bellowings there was no use of interrupting them for having taken a particular direction nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain
the travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but phileas fogg who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry remained in his seat and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way
passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them
what a country cried he mere cattle stop the trains and go by in a procession just as if they were not impeding travel parbleu i should like to know if mr fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme and heres an engineer who doesnt dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts
the engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle and he was wise he would have crushed the first buffaloes no doubt with the cow-catcher; but the locomotive however powerful would soon have been checked the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track and would then have been helpless
the best course was to wait patiently and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed the procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours and it was night before the track was clear the last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon
it was eight oclock when the train passed through the defiles of the humboldt range and half-past nine when it penetrated utah the region of the great salt lake the singular colony of the mormons
chapter xxvii in which passepartout undergoes at a speed of twenty miles an hour a course of mormon history
during the night of the 5th of december the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction towards the great salt lake
passepartout about nine oclock went out upon the platform to take the air the weather was cold the heavens grey but it was not snowing the suns disc enlarged by the mist seemed an enormous ring of gold and passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform
this personage who had taken the train at elko was tall and dark with black moustache black stockings a black silk hat a black waistcoat black trousers a white cravat and dogskin gloves he might have been taken for a clergyman he went from one end of the train to the other and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscript
passepartout approached and read one of these notices which stated that elder william hitch mormon missionary taking advantage of his presence on train no 48 would deliver a lecture on mormonism in car no 117 from eleven to twelve oclock; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the latter day saints to attend
ill go said passepartout to himself he knew nothing of mormonism except the custom of polygamy which is its foundation
the news quickly spread through the train which contained about one hundred passengers thirty of whom at most attracted by the notice ensconced themselves in car no 117 passepartout took one of the front seats neither mr fogg nor fix cared to attend
at the appointed hour elder william hitch rose and in an irritated voice as if he had already been contradicted said i tell you that joe smith is a martyr that his brother hiram is a martyr and that the persecutions of the united states government against the prophets will also make a martyr of brigham young who dares to say the contrary?
no one ventured to gainsay the missionary whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage no doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the mormons were actually subjected the government had just succeeded with some difficulty in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule it had made itself master of utah and subjected that territory to the laws of the union after imprisoning brigham young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy the disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts and resisted by words at least the authority of congress elder hitch as is seen was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains
then emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures he related the history of the mormons from biblical times: how that in israel a mormon prophet of the tribe of joseph published the annals of the new religion and bequeathed them to his son mormon; how many centuries later a translation of this precious book which was written in egyptian was made by joseph smith junior a vermont farmer who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how in short the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest and gave him the annals of the lord
several of the audience not being much interested in the missionarys narrative here left the car; but elder hitch continuing his lecture related how smith junior with his father two brothers and a few disciples founded the church of the latter day saints which adopted not only in america but in england norway and sweden and germany counts many artisans as well as men engaged in the liberal professions among its members; how a colony was established in ohio a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars and a town built at kirkland; how smith became an enterprising banker and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by abraham and several famous egyptians
the elders story became somewhat wearisome and his audience grew gradually less until it was reduced to twenty passengers but this did not disconcert the enthusiast who proceeded with the story of joseph smiths bankruptcy in 1837 and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards more honourable and honoured than ever at independence missouri the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples and his pursuit thence by outraged gentiles and retirement into the far west
ten hearers only were now left among them honest passepartout who was listening with all his ears thus he learned that after long persecutions smith reappeared in illinois and in 1839 founded a community at nauvoo on the mississippi numbering twenty-five thousand souls of which he became mayor chief justice and general-in-chief; that he announced himself in 1843 as a candidate for the presidency of the united states; and that finally being drawn into ambuscade at carthage he was thrown into prison and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks
passepartout was now the only person left in the car and the elder looking him full in the face reminded him that two years after the assassination of joseph smith the inspired prophet brigham young his successor left nauvoo for the banks of the great salt lake where in the midst of that fertile region directly on the route of the emigrants who crossed utah on their way to california the new colony thanks to the polygamy practised by the mormons had flourished beyond expectations
and this added elder william hitch this is why the jealousy of congress has been aroused against us why have the soldiers of the union invaded the soil of utah? why has brigham young our chief been imprisoned in contempt of all justice? shall we yield to force? never driven from vermont driven from illinois driven from ohio driven from missouri driven from utah we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents and you my brother continued the elder fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor will you not plant yours there too under the shadow of our flag?
no replied passepartout courageously in his turn retiring from the car and leaving the elder to preach to vacancy
during the lecture the train had been making good progress and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the great salt lake thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea which is also called the dead sea and into which flows an american jordan it is a picturesque expanse framed in lofty crags in large strata encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water which was formerly of larger extent than now its shores having encroached with the lapse of time and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth
the salt lake seventy miles long and thirty-five wide is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea quite different from lake asphaltite whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea it contains considerable salt and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter its specific weight being 1170 and after being distilled 1000 fishes are of course unable to live in it and those which descend through the jordan the weber and other streams soon perish
the country around the lake was well cultivated for the mormons are mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals fields of wheat corn and other cereals luxuriant prairies hedges of wild rose clumps of acacias and milk-wort would have been seen six months later now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow
the train reached ogden at two oclock where it rested for six hours mr fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to salt lake city connected with ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in this strikingly american town built on the pattern of other cities of the union like a checker-board with the sombre sadness of right-angles as victor hugo expresses it the founder of the city of the saints could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the anglo-saxons in this strange country where the people are certainly not up to the level of their institutions everything is done squarely--cities houses and follies
the travellers then were promenading at three oclock about the streets of the town built between the banks of the jordan and the spurs of the wahsatch range they saw few or no churches but the prophets mansion the court-house and the arsenal blue-brick houses with verandas and porches surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias palms and locusts a clay and pebble wall built in 1853 surrounded the town; and in the principal street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions the place did not seem thickly populated the streets were almost deserted except in the vicinity of the temple which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades there were many women which was easily accounted for by the peculiar institution of the mormons; but it must not be supposed that all the mormons are polygamists they are free to marry or not as they please; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of utah who are anxious to marry as according to the mormon religion maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys these poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy some--the more well-to-do no doubt--wore short open black silk dresses under a hood or modest shawl; others were habited in indian fashion
passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women charged in groups with conferring happiness on a single mormon his common sense pitied above all the husband it seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life and to conduct them as it were in a body to the mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious smith who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place to all eternity he felt decidedly repelled from such a vocation and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair ones of salt lake city cast rather alarming glances on his person happily his stay there was but brief at four the party found themselves again at the station took their places in the train and the whistle sounded for starting just at the moment however that the locomotive wheels began to move cries of stop stop were heard
trains like time and tide stop for no one the gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated mormon he was breathless with running happily for him the station had neither gates nor barriers he rushed along the track jumped on the rear platform of the train and fell exhausted into one of the seats
passepartout who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast approached him with lively interest and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene
when the mormon had recovered his breath passepartout ventured to ask him politely how many wives he had; for from the manner in which he had decamped it might be thought that he had twenty at least
one sir replied the mormon raising his arms heavenward--one and that was enough
chapter xxviii in which passepartout does not succeed in making anybody listen to reason
the train on leaving great salt lake at ogden passed northward for an hour as far as weber river having completed nearly nine hundred miles from san francisco from this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged wahsatch mountains it was in the section included between this range and the rocky mountains that the american engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains but the engineers instead of violating nature avoided its difficulties by winding around instead of penetrating the rocks one tunnel only fourteen thousand feet in length was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin
the track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the great salt lake from this point it described a long curve descending towards bitter creek valley to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the atlantic and the pacific there were many creeks in this mountainous region and it was necessary to cross muddy creek green creek and others upon culverts
passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on while fix longed to get out of this difficult region and was more anxious than phileas fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents and set foot on english soil
at ten oclock at night the train stopped at fort bridger station and twenty minutes later entered wyoming territory following the valley of bitter creek throughout the next day 7th december they stopped for a quarter of an hour at green river station snow had fallen abundantly during the night but being mixed with rain it had half melted and did not interrupt their progress the bad weather however annoyed passepartout; for the accumulation of snow by blocking the wheels of the cars would certainly have been fatal to mr foggs tour
what an idea he said to himself why did my master make this journey in winter? couldnt he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?
while the worthy frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause
several passengers had got off at green river and were walking up and down the platforms; and among these aouda recognised colonel stamp proctor the same who had so grossly insulted phileas fogg at the san francisco meeting not wishing to be recognised the young woman drew back from the window feeling much alarm at her discovery she was attached to the man who however coldly gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion she did not comprehend perhaps the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her which she called gratitude but which though she was unconscious of it was really more than that her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom mr fogg desired sooner or later to call to account for his conduct chance alone it was clear had brought colonel proctor on this train; but there he was and it was necessary at all hazards that phileas fogg should not perceive his adversary
aouda seized a moment when mr fogg was asleep to tell fix and passepartout whom she had seen
that proctor on this train cried fix well reassure yourself madam; before he settles with mr fogg; he has got to deal with me it seems to me that i was the more insulted of the two
and besides added passepartout ill take charge of him colonel as he is
mr fix resumed aouda mr fogg will allow no one to avenge him he said that he would come back to america to find this man should he perceive colonel proctor we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results he must not see him
you are right madam replied fix; a meeting between them might ruin all whether he were victorious or beaten mr fogg would be delayed and--
and added passepartout that would play the game of the gentlemen of the reform club in four days we shall be in new york well if my master does not leave this car during those four days we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded american we must if possible prevent his stirring out of it
the conversation dropped mr fogg had just woke up and was looking out of the window soon after passepartout without being heard by his master or aouda whispered to the detective would you really fight for him?
i would do anything replied fix in a tone which betrayed determined will to get him back living to europe
passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame but his confidence in his master remained unbroken
was there any means of detaining mr fogg in the car to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel? it ought not to be a difficult task since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious the detective at least seemed to have found a way; for after a few moments he said to mr fogg these are long and slow hours sir that we are passing on the railway
yes replied mr fogg; but they pass
you were in the habit of playing whist resumed fix on the steamers
yes; but it would be difficult to do so here i have neither cards nor partners
oh but we can easily buy some cards for they are sold on all the american trains and as for partners if madam plays--
certainly sir aouda quickly replied; i understand whist it is part of an english education
i myself have some pretensions to playing a good game well here are three of us and a dummy--
as you please sir replied phileas fogg heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway
passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward and soon returned with two packs of cards some pins counters and a shelf covered with cloth
the game commenced aouda understood whist sufficiently well and even received some compliments on her playing from mr fogg as for the detective he was simply an adept and worthy of being matched against his present opponent
now thought passepartout weve got him he wont budge
at eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at bridger pass seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the rocky mountains after going about two hundred miles the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the atlantic and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road
on the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streams branches of the north platte river already appeared the whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the rocky mountains the highest being laramie peak between this and the railway extended vast plains plentifully irrigated on the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the arkansas river one of the great tributaries of the missouri
at half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of fort halleck which commands that section; and in a few more hours the rocky mountains were crossed there was reason to hope then that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country the snow had ceased falling and the air became crisp and cold large birds frightened by the locomotive rose and flew off in the distance no wild beast appeared on the plain it was a desert in its vast nakedness
after a comfortable breakfast served in the car mr fogg and his partners had just resumed whist when a violent whistling was heard and the train stopped passepartout put his head out of the door but saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view
aouda and fix feared that mr fogg might take it into his head to get out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant see what is the matter
passepartout rushed out of the car thirty or forty passengers had already descended amongst them colonel stamp proctor
the train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way the engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man whom the station-master at medicine bow the next stopping place had sent on before the passengers drew around and took part in the discussion in which colonel proctor with his insolent manner was conspicuous
passepartout joining the group heard the signal-man say no you cant pass the bridge at medicine bow is shaky and would not bear the weight of the train
this was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids about a mile from the place where they now were according to the signal-man it was in a ruinous condition several of the iron wires being broken; and it was impossible to risk the passage he did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge it may be taken for granted that rash as the americans usually are when they are prudent there is good reason for it
passepartout not daring to apprise his master of what he heard listened with set teeth immovable as a statue
hum cried colonel proctor; but we are not going to stay here i imagine and take root in the snow?
colonel replied the conductor we have telegraphed to omaha for a train but it is not likely that it will reach medicine bow in less than six hours
six hours cried passepartout certainly returned the conductor besides it will take us as long as that to reach medicine bow on foot
but it is only a mile from here said one of the passengers
yes but its on the other side of the river
and cant we cross that in a boat? asked the colonel
thats impossible the creek is swelled by the rains it is a rapid and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford
the colonel launched a volley of oaths denouncing the railway company and the conductor; and passepartout who was furious was not disinclined to make common cause with him here was an obstacle indeed which all his masters banknotes could not remove
there was a general disappointment among the passengers who without reckoning the delay saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow they grumbled and protested and would certainly have thus attracted phileas foggs attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game
passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred and with hanging head he was turning towards the car when the engineer a true yankee named forster called out gentlemen perhaps there is a way after all to get over
on the bridge? asked a passenger
on the bridge with our train?
with our train passepartout stopped short and eagerly listened to the engineer
but the bridge is unsafe urged the conductor
no matter replied forster; i think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over
the devil muttered passepartout but a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineers proposal and colonel proctor was especially delighted and found the plan a very feasible one he told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges by putting on full steam; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineers mind
we have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over said one
eighty ninety passepartout was astounded and though ready to attempt anything to get over medicine creek thought the experiment proposed a little too american besides thought he theres a still more simple way and it does not even occur to any of these people sir said he aloud to one of the passengers the engineers plan seems to me a little dangerous but--
eighty chances replied the passenger turning his back on him
i know it said passepartout turning to another passenger but a simple idea--
ideas are no use returned the american shrugging his shoulders as the engineer assures us that we can pass
doubtless urged passepartout we can pass but perhaps it would be more prudent--
what prudent cried colonel proctor whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously at full speed dont you see at full speed
i know--i see repeated passepartout; but it would be if not more prudent since that word displeases you at least more natural--
who what whats the matter with this fellow? cried several
the poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself
are you afraid? asked colonel proctor
i afraid? very well; i will show these people that a frenchman can be as american as they
all aboard cried the conductor yes all aboard repeated passepartout and immediately but they cant prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot and let the train come after
but no one heard this sage reflection nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice the passengers resumed their places in the cars passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed the whist-players were quite absorbed in their game
the locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer reversing the steam backed the train for nearly a mile--retiring like a jumper in order to take a longer leap then with another whistle he began to move forward; the train increased its speed and soon its rapidity became frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second they perceived that the whole train rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour hardly bore upon the rails at all
and they passed over it was like a flash no one saw the bridge the train leaped so to speak from one bank to the other and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station but scarcely had the train passed the river when the bridge completely ruined fell with a crash into the rapids of medicine bow
chapter xxix in which certain incidents are narrated which are only to be met with on american railroads
the train pursued its course that evening without interruption passing fort saunders crossing cheyne pass and reaching evans pass the road here attained the highest elevation of the journey eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea the travellers had now only to descend to the atlantic by limitless plains levelled by nature a branch of the grand trunk led off southward to denver the capital of colorado the country round about is rich in gold and silver and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there
thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from san francisco in three days and three nights; four days and nights more would probably bring them to new york phileas fogg was not as yet behind-hand
during the night camp walbach was passed on the left; lodge pole creek ran parallel with the road marking the boundary between the territories of wyoming and colorado they entered nebraska at eleven passed near sedgwick and touched at julesburg on the southern branch of the platte river
it was here that the union pacific railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of october 1867 by the chief engineer general dodge two powerful locomotives carrying nine cars of invited guests amongst whom was thomas c durant vice-president of the road stopped at this point; cheers were given the sioux and pawnees performed an imitation indian battle fireworks were let off and the first number of the railway pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation thrown across the desert and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist the whistle of the locomotive more powerful than amphions lyre was about to bid them rise from american soil
fort mcpherson was left behind at eight in the morning and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching omaha the road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the platte river on its left bank at nine the train stopped at the important town of north platte built between the two arms of the river which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery a large tributary whose waters empty into the missouri a little above omaha
the one hundred and first meridian was passed
mr fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not even the dummy--complained of the length of the trip fix had begun by winning several guineas which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than mr fogg during the morning chance distinctly favoured that gentleman trumps and honours were showered upon his hands
once having resolved on a bold stroke he was on the point of playing a spade when a voice behind him said i should play a diamond
mr fogg aouda and fix raised their heads and beheld colonel proctor
stamp proctor and phileas fogg recognised each other at once
ah its you is it englishman? cried the colonel; its you who are going to play a spade
and who plays it replied phileas fogg coolly throwing down the ten of spades
well it pleases me to have it diamonds replied colonel proctor in an insolent tone
he made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played adding you dont understand anything about whist
perhaps i do as well as another said phileas fogg rising
you have only to try son of john bull replied the colonel
aouda turned pale and her blood ran cold she seized mr foggs arm and gently pulled him back passepartout was ready to pounce upon the american who was staring insolently at his opponent but fix got up and going to colonel proctor said you forget that it is i with whom you have to deal sir; for it was i whom you not only insulted but struck
mr fix said mr fogg pardon me but this affair is mine and mine only the colonel has again insulted me by insisting that i should not play a spade and he shall give me satisfaction for it
when and where you will replied the american and with whatever weapon you choose
aouda in vain attempted to retain mr fogg; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window but a sign from his master checked him phileas fogg left the car and the american followed him upon the platform sir said mr fogg to his adversary i am in a great hurry to get back to europe and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage
well whats that to me? replied colonel proctor
sir said mr fogg very politely after our meeting at san francisco i determined to return to america and find you as soon as i had completed the business which called me to england
really will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?
why not ten years hence? i say six months returned phileas fogg; and i shall be at the place of meeting promptly
all this is an evasion cried stamp proctor now or never
very good you are going to new york?
no to chicago? no to omaha?
what difference is it to you? do you know plum creek?
no replied mr fogg its the next station the train will be there in an hour and will stop there ten minutes in ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged
very well said mr fogg i will stop at plum creek
and i guess youll stay there too added the american insolently
who knows? replied mr fogg returning to the car as coolly as usual he began to reassure aouda telling her that blusterers were never to be feared and begged fix to be his second at the approaching duel a request which the detective could not refuse mr fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness
at eleven oclock the locomotives whistle announced that they were approaching plum creek station mr fogg rose and followed by fix went out upon the platform passepartout accompanied him carrying a pair of revolvers aouda remained in the car as pale as death
the door of the next car opened and colonel proctor appeared on the platform attended by a yankee of his own stamp as his second but just as the combatants were about to step from the train the conductor hurried up and shouted you cant get off gentlemen
why not? asked the colonel we are twenty minutes late and we shall not stop
but i am going to fight a duel with this gentleman
i am sorry said the conductor; but we shall be off at once theres the bell ringing now
the train started im really very sorry gentlemen said the conductor under any other circumstances i should have been happy to oblige you but after all as you have not had time to fight here why not fight as we go along?
that wouldnt be convenient perhaps for this gentleman said the colonel in a jeering tone
it would be perfectly so replied phileas fogg
well we are really in america thought passepartout and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order
so muttering he followed his master
the two combatants their seconds and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train the last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle the passengers granted the request with alacrity and straightway disappeared on the platform
the car which was some fifty feet long was very convenient for their purpose the adversaries might march on each other in the aisle and fire at their ease never was duel more easily arranged mr fogg and colonel proctor each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers entered the car the seconds remaining outside shut them in they were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive after an interval of two minutes what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car
nothing could be more simple indeed it was all so simple that fix and passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack they were listening for the whistle agreed upon when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were the reports continued in front and the whole length of the train cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars
colonel proctor and mr fogg revolvers in hand hastily quitted their prison and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous they then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of sioux
this was not the first attempt of these daring indians for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road a hundred of them had according to their habit jumped upon the steps without stopping the train with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop
the sioux were armed with guns from which came the reports to which the passengers who were almost all armed responded by revolver-shots
the indians had first mounted the engine and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets a sioux chief wishing to stop the train but not knowing how to work the regulator had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity
the sioux had at the same time invaded the cars skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs thrusting open the doors and fighting hand to hand with the passengers penetrating the baggage-car they pillaged it throwing the trunks out of the train the cries and shots were constant the travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded and sustained a siege like moving forts carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour
aouda behaved courageously from the first she defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance twenty sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms several passengers shot or stunned lay on the seats
it was necessary to put an end to the struggle which had lasted for ten minutes and which would result in the triumph of the sioux if the train was not stopped fort kearney station where there was a garrison was only two miles distant; but that once passed the sioux would be masters of the train between fort kearney and the station beyond
the conductor was fighting beside mr fogg when he was shot and fell at the same moment he cried unless the train is stopped in five minutes we are lost
it shall be stopped said phileas fogg preparing to rush from the car
stay monsieur cried passepartout; i will go
mr fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow who opening a door unperceived by the indians succeeded in slipping under the car; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head he made use of his old acrobatic experience and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars holding on to the chains aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill and thus gaining the forward end of the train
there suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender with the other he loosened the safety chains; but owing to the traction he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out the train now detached from the engine remained a little behind whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed
carried on by the force already acquired the train still moved for several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped less than a hundred feet from kearney station
the soldiers of the fort attracted by the shots hurried up; the sioux had not expected them and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped
but when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing; among others the courageous frenchman whose devotion had just saved them
chapter xxx in which phileas fogg simply does his duty
three passengers including passepartout had disappeared had they been killed in the struggle? were they taken prisoners by the sioux? it was impossible to tell
there were many wounded but none mortally colonel proctor was one of the most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely and a ball had entered his groin he was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers to receive such attention as could be of avail
aouda was safe; and phileas fogg who had been in the thickest of the fight had not received a scratch fix was slightly wounded in the arm but passepartout was not to be found and tears coursed down aoudas cheeks
all the passengers had got out of the train the wheels of which were stained with blood from the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh as far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind red trails were visible the last sioux were disappearing in the south along the banks of republican river
mr fogg with folded arms remained motionless he had a serious decision to make aouda standing near him looked at him without speaking and he understood her look if his servant was a prisoner ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the indians? i will find him living or dead said he quietly to aouda
ah mr--mr fogg cried she clasping his hands and covering them with tears
living added mr fogg if we do not lose a moment
phileas fogg by this resolution inevitably sacrificed himself; he pronounced his own doom the delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at new york and his bet would be certainly lost but as he thought it is my duty he did not hesitate
the commanding officer of fort kearney was there a hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station should the sioux attack it
sir said mr fogg to the captain three passengers have disappeared
dead? asked the captain dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must be solved do you propose to pursue the sioux?
thats a serious thing to do sir returned the captain these indians may retreat beyond the arkansas and i cannot leave the fort unprotected
the lives of three men are in question sir said phileas fogg
doubtless; but can i risk the lives of fifty men to save three?
i dont know whether you can sir; but you ought to do so
nobody here returned the other has a right to teach me my duty
very well said mr fogg coldly i will go alone
you sir cried fix coming up; you go alone in pursuit of the indians?
would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish--him to whom every one present owes his life? i shall go
no sir you shall not go alone cried the captain touched in spite of himself no you are a brave man thirty volunteers he added turning to the soldiers
the whole company started forward at once the captain had only to pick his men thirty were chosen and an old sergeant placed at their head
thanks captain said mr fogg will you let me go with you? asked fix
do as you please sir but if you wish to do me a favour you will remain with aouda in case anything should happen to me--
a sudden pallor overspread the detectives face separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step leave him to wander about in this desert fix gazed attentively at mr fogg and despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look
i will stay said he a few moments after mr fogg pressed the young womans hand and having confided to her his precious carpet-bag went off with the sergeant and his little squad but before going he had said to the soldiers my friends i will divide five thousand dollars among you if we save the prisoners
it was then a little past noon
aouda retired to a waiting-room and there she waited alone thinking of the simple and noble generosity the tranquil courage of phileas fogg he had sacrificed his fortune and was now risking his life all without hesitation from duty in silence
fix did not have the same thoughts and could scarcely conceal his agitation he walked feverishly up and down the platform but soon resumed his outward composure he now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting fogg go alone what this man whom he had just followed around the world was permitted now to separate himself from him he began to accuse and abuse himself and as if he were director of police administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness
i have been an idiot he thought and this man will see it he has gone and wont come back but how is it that i fix who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest have been so fascinated by him? decidedly i am nothing but an ass
so reasoned the detective while the hours crept by all too slowly he did not know what to do sometimes he was tempted to tell aouda all; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences what course should he take? he thought of pursuing fogg across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him footsteps were easily printed on the snow but soon under a new sheet every imprint would be effaced
fix became discouraged he felt a sort of insurmountable longing to abandon the game altogether he could now leave fort kearney station and pursue his journey homeward in peace
towards two oclock in the afternoon while it was snowing hard long whistles were heard approaching from the east a great shadow preceded by a wild light slowly advanced appearing still larger through the mist which gave it a fantastic aspect no train was expected from the east neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from omaha to san francisco was not due till the next day the mystery was soon explained
the locomotive which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles was that which having been detached from the train had continued its route with such terrific rapidity carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker it had run several miles when the fire becoming low for want of fuel the steam had slackened; and it had finally stopped an hour after some twenty miles beyond fort kearney neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead and after remaining for some time in their swoon had come to themselves the train had then stopped the engineer when he found himself in the desert and the locomotive without cars understood what had happened he could not imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress
he did not hesitate what to do it would be prudent to continue on to omaha for it would be dangerous to return to the train which the indians might still be engaged in pillaging nevertheless he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted and the locomotive returned running backwards to fort kearney this it was which was whistling in the mist
the travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the head of the train they could now continue the journey so terribly interrupted
aouda on seeing the locomotive come up hurried out of the station and asked the conductor are you going to start?
at once madam but the prisoners our unfortunate fellow-travellers--
i cannot interrupt the trip replied the conductor we are already three hours behind time
and when will another train pass here from san francisco?
to-morrow evening madam to-morrow evening but then it will be too late we must wait--
it is impossible responded the conductor if you wish to go please get in
i will not go said aouda
fix had heard this conversation a little while before when there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey he had made up his mind to leave fort kearney; but now that the train was there ready to start and he had only to take his seat in the car an irresistible influence held him back the station platform burned his feet and he could not stir the conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifled him he wished to struggle on to the end
meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded among them colonel proctor whose injuries were serious had taken their places in the train the buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard and the steam was escaping from the valves the engineer whistled the train started and soon disappeared mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow
the detective had remained behind several hours passed the weather was dismal and it was very cold fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have been thought asleep aouda despite the storm kept coming out of the waiting-room going to the end of the platform and peering through the tempest of snow as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her and to hear if possible some welcome sound she heard and saw nothing then she would return chilled through to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments but always in vain
evening came and the little band had not returned where could they be? had they found the indians and were they having a conflict with them or were they still wandering amid the mist? the commander of the fort was anxious though he tried to conceal his apprehensions as night approached the snow fell less plentifully but it became intensely cold absolute silence rested on the plains neither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm
throughout the night aouda full of sad forebodings her heart stifled with anguish wandered about on the verge of the plains her imagination carried her far off and showed her innumerable dangers what she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe
fix remained stationary in the same place but did not sleep once a man approached and spoke to him and the detective merely replied by shaking his head
thus the night passed at dawn the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off phileas fogg and the squad had gone southward; in the south all was still vacancy it was then seven oclock
the captain who was really alarmed did not know what course to take
should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first? should he sacrifice more men with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed? his hesitation did not last long however calling one of his lieutenants he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance when gunshots were heard was it a signal? the soldiers rushed out of the fort and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order
mr fogg was marching at their head and just behind him were passepartout and the other two travellers rescued from the sioux
they had met and fought the indians ten miles south of fort kearney shortly before the detachment arrived passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors three of whom the frenchman had felled with his fists when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief
all were welcomed with joyful cries phileas fogg distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers while passepartout not without reason muttered to himself it must certainly be confessed that i cost my master dear
fix without saying a word looked at mr fogg and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him as for aouda she took her protectors hand and pressed it in her own too much moved to speak
meanwhile passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he should find it there ready to start for omaha and he hoped that the time lost might be regained
the train the train cried he
gone replied fix and when does the next train pass here? said phileas fogg
not till this evening ah returned the impassible gentleman quietly
chapter xxxi in which fix the detective considerably furthers the interests of phileas fogg
phileas fogg found himself twenty hours behind time passepartout the involuntary cause of this delay was desperate he had ruined his master
at this moment the detective approached mr fogg and looking him intently in the face said:
seriously sir are you in great haste?
quite seriously i have a purpose in asking resumed fix is it absolutely necessary that you should be in new york on the 11th before nine oclock in the evening the time that the steamer leaves for liverpool?
it is absolutely necessary and if your journey had not been interrupted by these indians you would have reached new york on the morning of the 11th?
yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left
good you are therefore twenty hours behind twelve from twenty leaves eight you must regain eight hours do you wish to try to do so?
on foot? asked mr fogg no; on a sledge replied fix on a sledge with sails a man has proposed such a method to me
it was the man who had spoken to fix during the night and whose offer he had refused
phileas fogg did not reply at once; but fix having pointed out the man who was walking up and down in front of the station mr fogg went up to him an instant after mr fogg and the american whose name was mudge entered a hut built just below the fort
there mr fogg examined a curious vehicle a kind of frame on two long beams a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge and upon which there was room for five or six persons a high mast was fixed on the frame held firmly by metallic lashings to which was attached a large brigantine sail this mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail behind a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle it was in short a sledge rigged like a sloop during the winter when the trains are blocked up by the snow these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another provided with more sails than a cutter and with the wind behind them they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains
mr fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft the wind was favourable being fresh and blowing from the west the snow had hardened and mudge was very confident of being able to transport mr fogg in a few hours to omaha thence the trains eastward run frequently to chicago and new york it was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected
not wishing to expose aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the open air mr fogg proposed to leave her with passepartout at fort kearney the servant taking upon himself to escort her to europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions but aouda refused to separate from mr fogg and passepartout was delighted with her decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while fix was with him
it would be difficult to guess the detectives thoughts was this conviction shaken by phileas foggs return or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal who his journey round the world completed would think himself absolutely safe in england? perhaps fixs opinion of phileas fogg was somewhat modified; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty and to hasten the return of the whole party to england as much as possible
at eight oclock the sledge was ready to start the passengers took their places on it and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks the two great sails were hoisted and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour
the distance between fort kearney and omaha as the birds fly is at most two hundred miles if the wind held good the distance might be traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach omaha by one oclock
what a journey the travellers huddled close together could not speak for the cold intensified by the rapidity at which they were going the sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves when the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by its sails mudge who was at the rudder kept in a straight line and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make all the sails were up and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine a top-mast was hoisted and another jib held out to the wind added its force to the other sails although the speed could not be exactly estimated the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour
if nothing breaks said mudge we shall get there
mr fogg had made it for mudges interest to reach omaha within the time agreed on by the offer of a handsome reward
the prairie across which the sledge was moving in a straight line was as flat as a sea it seemed like a vast frozen lake the railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by great island columbus an important nebraska town schuyler and fremont to omaha it followed throughout the right bank of the platte river the sledge shortening this route took a chord of the arc described by the railway mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the platte river because it was frozen the road then was quite clear of obstacles and phileas fogg had but two things to fear--an accident to the sledge and a change or calm in the wind
but the breeze far from lessening its force blew as if to bend the mast which however the metallic lashings held firmly these lashings like the chords of a stringed instrument resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow the sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody
those chords give the fifth and the octave said mr fogg
these were the only words he uttered during the journey aouda cosily packed in furs and cloaks was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind as for passepartout his face was as red as the suns disc when it sets in the mist and he laboriously inhaled the biting air with his natural buoyancy of spirits he began to hope again they would reach new york on the evening if not on the morning of the 11th and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for liverpool
passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally fix by the hand he remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge the only means of reaching omaha in time; but checked by some presentiment he kept his usual reserve one thing however passepartout would never forget and that was the sacrifice which mr fogg had made without hesitation to rescue him from the sioux mr fogg had risked his fortune and his life no his servant would never forget that
while each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow the creeks it passed over were not perceived fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness the plain was absolutely deserted between the union pacific road and the branch which unites kearney with saint joseph it formed a great uninhabited island neither village station nor fort appeared from time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind sometimes flocks of wild birds rose or bands of gaunt famished ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge passepartout revolver in hand held himself ready to fire on those which came too near had an accident then happened to the sledge the travellers attacked by these beasts would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even course soon gained on the wolves and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind
about noon mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing the platte river he said nothing but he felt certain that he was now within twenty miles of omaha in less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails whilst the sledge carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it went on half a mile further with its sails unspread
it stopped at last and mudge pointing to a mass of roofs white with snow said: we have got there
arrived arrived at the station which is in daily communication by numerous trains with the atlantic seaboard
passepartout and fix jumped off stretched their stiffened limbs and aided mr fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge phileas fogg generously rewarded mudge whose hand passepartout warmly grasped and the party directed their steps to the omaha railway station
the pacific railroad proper finds its terminus at this important nebraska town omaha is connected with chicago by the chicago and rock island railroad which runs directly east and passes fifty stations
a train was ready to start when mr fogg and his party reached the station and they only had time to get into the cars they had seen nothing of omaha; but passepartout confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted as they were not travelling to see the sights
the train passed rapidly across the state of iowa by council bluffs des moines and iowa city during the night it crossed the mississippi at davenport and by rock island entered illinois the next day which was the 10th at four oclock in the evening it reached chicago already risen from its ruins and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful lake michigan
nine hundred miles separated chicago from new york; but trains are not wanting at chicago mr fogg passed at once from one to the other and the locomotive of the pittsburgh fort wayne and chicago railway left at full speed as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose it traversed indiana ohio pennsylvania and new jersey like a flash rushing through towns with antique names some of which had streets and car-tracks but as yet no houses at last the hudson came into view; and at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river before the very pier of the cunard line
the china for liverpool had started three-quarters of an hour before
chapter xxxii in which phileas fogg engages in a direct struggle with bad fortune
the china in leaving seemed to have carried off phileas foggs last hope none of the other steamers were able to serve his projects the pereire of the french transatlantic company whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort did not leave until the 14th; the hamburg boats did not go directly to liverpool or london but to havre; and the additional trip from havre to southampton would render phileas foggs last efforts of no avail the inman steamer did not depart till the next day and could not cross the atlantic in time to save the wager
mr fogg learned all this in consulting his bradshaw which gave him the daily movements of the trans-atlantic steamers
passepartout was crushed; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour it was his fault for instead of helping his master he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path and when he recalled all the incidents of the tour when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account when he thought that the immense stake added to the heavy charges of this useless journey would completely ruin mr fogg he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations mr fogg however did not reproach him; and on leaving the cunard pier only said: we will consult about what is best to-morrow come
the party crossed the hudson in the jersey city ferryboat and drove in a carriage to the st nicholas hotel on broadway rooms were engaged and the night passed briefly to phileas fogg who slept profoundly but very long to aouda and the others whose agitation did not permit them to rest
the next day was the 12th of december from seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days thirteen hours and forty-five minutes if phileas fogg had left in the china one of the fastest steamers on the atlantic he would have reached liverpool and then london within the period agreed upon
mr fogg left the hotel alone after giving passepartout instructions to await his return and inform aouda to be ready at an instants notice he proceeded to the banks of the hudson and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river for any that were about to depart several had departure signals and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe but they were mostly sailing vessels of which of course phileas fogg could make no use
he seemed about to give up all hope when he espied anchored at the battery a cables length off at most a trading vessel with a screw well-shaped whose funnel puffing a cloud of smoke indicated that she was getting ready for departure
phileas fogg hailed a boat got into it and soon found himself on board the henrietta iron-hulled wood-built above he ascended to the deck and asked for the captain who forthwith presented himself he was a man of fifty a sort of sea-wolf with big eyes a complexion of oxidised copper red hair and thick neck and a growling voice
the captain? asked mr fogg i am the captain
i am phileas fogg of london
and i am andrew speedy of cardiff
you are going to put to sea?
in an hour you are bound for--
bordeaux and your cargo? no freight going in ballast
have you any passengers? no passengers never have passengers too much in the way
is your vessel a swift one?
between eleven and twelve knots the henrietta well known
will you carry me and three other persons to liverpool?
to liverpool? why not to china?
i said liverpool no no? no i am setting out for bordeaux and shall go to bordeaux
money is no object? none the captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply
but the owners of the henrietta-- resumed phileas fogg
the owners are myself replied the captain the vessel belongs to me
i will freight it for you
no i will buy it of you
no phileas fogg did not betray the least disappointment; but the situation was a grave one it was not at new york as at hong kong nor with the captain of the henrietta as with the captain of the tankadere up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle now money failed
still some means must be found to cross the atlantic on a boat unless by balloon--which would have been venturesome besides not being capable of being put in practice it seemed that phileas fogg had an idea for he said to the captain well will you carry me to bordeaux?
no not if you paid me two hundred dollars
i offer you two thousand apiece?
apiece and there are four of you?
four captain speedy began to scratch his head there were eight thousand dollars to gain without changing his route; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers besides passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers but valuable merchandise i start at nine oclock said captain speedy simply are you and your party ready?
we will be on board at nine oclock replied no less simply mr fogg
it was half-past eight to disembark from the henrietta jump into a hack hurry to the st nicholas and return with aouda passepartout and even the inseparable fix was the work of a brief time and was performed by mr fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him they were on board when the henrietta made ready to weigh anchor
when passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost he uttered a prolonged oh which extended throughout his vocal gamut
as for fix he said to himself that the bank of england would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified when they reached england even if mr fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills into the sea more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent
chapter xxxiii in which phileas fogg shows himself equal to the occasion
an hour after the henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the hudson turned the point of sandy hook and put to sea during the day she skirted long island passed fire island and directed her course rapidly eastward
at noon the next day a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessels position it might be thought that this was captain speedy not the least in the world it was phileas fogg esquire as for captain speedy he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key and was uttering loud cries which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive
what had happened was very simple phileas fogg wished to go to liverpool but the captain would not carry him there then phileas fogg had taken passage for bordeaux and during the thirty hours he had been on board had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers who were only an occasional crew and were not on the best terms with the captain went over to him in a body this was why phileas fogg was in command instead of captain speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why in short the henrietta was directing her course towards liverpool it was very clear to see mr fogg manage the craft that he had been a sailor
how the adventure ended will be seen anon aouda was anxious though she said nothing as for passepartout he thought mr foggs manoeuvre simply glorious the captain had said between eleven and twelve knots and the henrietta confirmed his prediction
if then--for there were ifs still--the sea did not become too boisterous if the wind did not veer round to the east if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery the henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from new york to liverpool in the nine days between the 12th and the 21st of december it is true that once arrived the affair on board the henrietta added to that of the bank of england might create more difficulties for mr fogg than he imagined or could desire
during the first days they went along smoothly enough the sea was not very unpropitious the wind seemed stationary in the north-east the sails were hoisted and the henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-atlantic steamer
passepartout was delighted his masters last exploit the consequences of which he ignored enchanted him never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow he formed warm friendships with the sailors and amazed them with his acrobatic feats he thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen and that the stokers fired up like heroes his loquacious good-humour infected everyone he had forgotten the past its vexations and delays he only thought of the end so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience as if heated by the furnaces of the henrietta often also the worthy fellow revolved around fix looking at him with a keen distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him for their old intimacy no longer existed
fix it must be confessed understood nothing of what was going on the conquest of the henrietta the bribery of the crew fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman amazed and confused him he did not know what to think for after all a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the henrietta under foggs command was not going to liverpool at all but to some part of the world where the robber turned into a pirate would quietly put himself in safety the conjecture was at least a plausible one and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair
as for captain speedy he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and passepartout whose duty it was to carry him his meals courageous as he was took the greatest precautions mr fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board
on the 13th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundland a dangerous locality; during the winter especially there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind ever since the evening before the barometer suddenly falling had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied the cold became sharper and the wind veered to the south-east
this was a misfortune mr fogg in order not to deviate from his course furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessels speed slackened owing to the state of the sea the long waves of which broke against the stern she pitched violently and this retarded her progress the breeze little by little swelled into a tempest and it was to be feared that the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves
passepartouts visage darkened with the skies and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright but phileas fogg was a bold mariner and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course without even decreasing his steam the henrietta when she could not rise upon the waves crossed them swamping her deck but passing safely sometimes the screw rose out of the water beating its protruding end when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead
the wind however did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour it continued fresh but unhappily it remained obstinately in the south-east rendering the sails useless
the 16th of december was the seventy-fifth day since phileas foggs departure from london and the henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed half of the voyage was almost accomplished and the worst localities had been passed in summer success would have been well-nigh certain in winter they were at the mercy of the bad season passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret and comforted himself with the reflection that if the wind failed them they might still count on the steam
on this day the engineer came on deck went up to mr fogg and began to speak earnestly with him without knowing why it was a presentiment perhaps passepartout became vaguely uneasy he would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying he finally managed to catch a few words and was sure he heard his master say you are certain of what you tell me?
certain sir replied the engineer you must remember that since we started we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces and though we had coal enough to go on short steam from new york to bordeaux we havent enough to go with all steam from new york to liverpool i will consider replied mr fogg
passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety the coal was giving out ah if my master can get over that muttered he hell be a famous man he could not help imparting to fix what he had overheard
then you believe that we really are going to liverpool?
of course ass replied the detective shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel
passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world and refrained
and now what course would phileas fogg adopt? it was difficult to imagine nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one for that evening he sent for the engineer and said to him feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted
a few moments after the funnel of the henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke the vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th the engineer as he had predicted announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day
do not let the fires go down replied mr fogg keep them up to the last let the valves be filled
towards noon phileas fogg having ascertained their position called passepartout and ordered him to go for captain speedy it was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger he went to the poop saying to himself he will be like a madman
in a few moments with cries and oaths a bomb appeared on the poop-deck the bomb was captain speedy it was clear that he was on the point of bursting where are we? were the first words his anger permitted him to utter had the poor man been an apoplectic he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath
where are we? he repeated with purple face
seven hundred and seven miles from liverpool replied mr fogg with imperturbable calmness
pirate cried captain speedy i have sent for you sir--
pickaroon --sir continued mr fogg to ask you to sell me your vessel
no by all the devils no
but i shall be obliged to burn her
burn the henrietta yes; at least the upper part of her the coal has given out
burn my vessel cried captain speedy who could scarcely pronounce the words a vessel worth fifty thousand dollars
here are sixty thousand replied phileas fogg handing the captain a roll of bank-bills this had a prodigious effect on andrew speedy an american can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars the captain forgot in an instant his anger his imprisonment and all his grudges against his passenger the henrietta was twenty years old; it was a great bargain the bomb would not go off after all mr fogg had taken away the match
and i shall still have the iron hull said the captain in a softer tone
the iron hull and the engine is it agreed?
agreed and andrew speedy seizing the banknotes counted them and consigned them to his pocket
during this colloquy passepartout was as white as a sheet and fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended and fogg left the hull and engine to the captain that is near the whole value of the craft it was true however that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the bank
when andrew speedy had pocketed the money mr fogg said to him dont let this astonish you sir you must know that i shall lose twenty thousand pounds unless i arrive in london by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of december i missed the steamer at new york and as you refused to take me to liverpool--
and i did well cried andrew speedy; for i have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it he added more sedately do you know one thing captain--
fogg captain fogg youve got something of the yankee about you
and having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment he was going away when mr fogg said the vessel now belongs to me?
certainly from the keel to the truck of the masts--all the wood that is
very well have the interior seats bunks and frames pulled down and burn them
it was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure and on that day the poop cabins bunks and the spare deck were sacrificed on the next day the 19th of december the masts rafts and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily keeping up the fires passepartout hewed cut and sawed away with all his might there was a perfect rage for demolition
the railings fittings the greater part of the deck and top sides disappeared on the 20th and the henrietta was now only a flat hulk but on this day they sighted the irish coast and fastnet light by ten in the evening they were passing queenstown phileas fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to london; that length of time was necessary to reach liverpool with all steam on and the steam was about to give out altogether
sir said captain speedy who was now deeply interested in mr foggs project i really commiserate you everything is against you we are only opposite queenstown
ah said mr fogg is that place where we see the lights queenstown?
yes can we enter the harbour?
not under three hours only at high tide
stay replied mr fogg calmly without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune
queenstown is the irish port at which the trans-atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails these mails are carried to dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start; from dublin they are sent on to liverpool by the most rapid boats and thus gain twelve hours on the atlantic steamers
phileas fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way instead of arriving at liverpool the next evening by the henrietta he would be there by noon and would therefore have time to reach london before a quarter before nine in the evening
the henrietta entered queenstown harbour at one oclock in the morning it then being high tide; and phileas fogg after being grasped heartily by the hand by captain speedy left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft which was still worth half what he had sold it for
the party went on shore at once fix was greatly tempted to arrest mr fogg on the spot; but he did not why? what struggle was going on within him? had he changed his mind about his man? did he understand that he had made a grave mistake? he did not however abandon mr fogg they all got upon the train which was just ready to start at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in dublin; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which disdaining to rise upon the waves invariably cut through them
phileas fogg at last disembarked on the liverpool quay at twenty minutes before twelve 21st december he was only six hours distant from london
but at this moment fix came up put his hand upon mr foggs shoulder and showing his warrant said you are really phileas fogg?
i am i arrest you in the queens name
chapter xxxiv in which phileas fogg at last reaches london
phileas fogg was in prison he had been shut up in the custom house and he was to be transferred to london the next day
passepartout when he saw his master arrested would have fallen upon fix had he not been held back by some policemen aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous fogg was arrested as a robber the young womans heart revolted against so heinous a charge and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector she wept bitterly
as for fix he had arrested mr fogg because it was his duty whether mr fogg were guilty or not
the thought then struck passepartout that he was the cause of this new misfortune had he not concealed fixs errand from his master? when fix revealed his true character and purpose why had he not told mr fogg? if the latter had been warned he would no doubt have given fix proof of his innocence and satisfied him of his mistake; at least fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master only to arrest him the moment he set foot on english soil passepartout wept till he was blind and felt like blowing his brains out
aouda and he had remained despite the cold under the portico of the custom house neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to see mr fogg again
that gentleman was really ruined and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end this arrest was fatal having arrived at liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of december he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the reform club that is nine hours and a quarter; the journey from liverpool to london was six hours
if anyone at this moment had entered the custom house he would have found mr fogg seated motionless calm and without apparent anger upon a wooden bench he was not it is true resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion was he being devoured by one of those secret rages all the more terrible because contained and which only burst forth with an irresistible force at the last moment? no one could tell there he sat calmly waiting--for what? did he still cherish hope? did he still believe now that the door of this prison was closed upon him that he would succeed?
however that may have been mr fogg carefully put his watch upon the table and observed its advancing hands not a word escaped his lips but his look was singularly set and stern the situation in any event was a terrible one and might be thus stated: if phileas fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave he was caught
did escape occur to him? did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison? did he think of escaping from it? possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room but the door was locked and the window heavily barred with iron rods he sat down again and drew his journal from his pocket on the line where these words were written 21st december saturday liverpool he added 80th day 1140 am and waited
the custom house clock struck one mr fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast
two hours admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train he could reach london and the reform club by a quarter before nine pm his forehead slightly wrinkled
at thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside then a hasty opening of doors passepartouts voice was audible and immediately after that of fix phileas foggs eyes brightened for an instant
the door swung open and he saw passepartout aouda and fix who hurried towards him
fix was out of breath and his hair was in disorder he could not speak sir he stammered sir--forgive me--most--unfortunate resemblance--robber arrested three days ago--you are free
phileas fogg was free he walked to the detective looked him steadily in the face and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life or which he ever would make drew back his arms and with the precision of a machine knocked fix down
well hit cried passepartout parbleu thats what you might call a good application of english fists
fix who found himself on the floor did not utter a word he had only received his deserts mr fogg aouda and passepartout left the custom house without delay got into a cab and in a few moments descended at the station
phileas fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for london it was forty minutes past two the express train had left thirty-five minutes before phileas fogg then ordered a special train
there were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three oclock
at that hour phileas fogg having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward at last set out towards london with aouda and his faithful servant
it was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout but there were forced delays and when mr fogg stepped from the train at the terminus all the clocks in london were striking ten minutes before nine
having made the tour of the world he was behind-hand five minutes he had lost the wager
chapter xxxv in which phileas fogg does not have to repeat his orders to passepartout twice
the dwellers in saville row would have been surprised the next day if they had been told that phileas fogg had returned home his doors and windows were still closed no appearance of change was visible
after leaving the station mr fogg gave passepartout instructions to purchase some provisions and quietly went to his domicile
he bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity ruined and by the blundering of the detective after having steadily traversed that long journey overcome a hundred obstacles braved many dangers and still found time to do some good on his way to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen and against which he was unarmed; it was terrible but a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him there only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at barings and this amount he owed to his friends of the reform club so great had been the expense of his tour that even had he won it would not have enriched him; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself being a man who rather laid wagers for honours sake than for the stake proposed but this wager totally ruined him
mr foggs course however was fully decided upon; he knew what remained for him to do
a room in the house in saville row was set apart for aouda who was overwhelmed with grief at her protectors misfortune from the words which mr fogg dropped she saw that he was meditating some serious project
knowing that englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing
first of all the worthy fellow had gone up to his room and had extinguished the gas burner which had been burning for eighty days he had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense which he had been doomed to bear
the night passed mr fogg went to bed but did he sleep? aouda did not once close her eyes passepartout watched all night like a faithful dog at his masters door
mr fogg called him in the morning and told him to get aoudas breakfast and a cup of tea and a chop for himself he desired aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights in the evening he would ask permission to have a few moments conversation with the young lady
passepartout having received his orders had nothing to do but obey them he looked at his imperturbable master and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him his heart was full and his conscience tortured by remorse; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster yes if he had warned mr fogg and had betrayed fixs projects to him his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to liverpool and then--
passepartout could hold in no longer
my master mr fogg he cried why do you not curse me? it was my fault that--
i blame no one returned phileas fogg with perfect calmness go
passepartout left the room and went to find aouda to whom he delivered his masters message
madam he added i can do nothing myself--nothing i have no influence over my master; but you perhaps--
what influence could i have? replied aouda mr fogg is influenced by no one has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing? has he ever read my heart? my friend he must not be left alone an instant you say he is going to speak with me this evening?
yes madam; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in england
we shall see replied aouda becoming suddenly pensive
throughout this day (sunday) the house in saville row was as if uninhabited and phileas fogg for the first time since he had lived in that house did not set out for his club when westminster clock struck half-past eleven
why should he present himself at the reform? his friends no longer expected him there as phileas fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before (saturday the 21st of december at a quarter before nine) he had lost his wager it was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands and they had only to fill it out and send it to the barings to have the amount transferred to their credit
mr fogg therefore had no reason for going out and so he remained at home he shut himself up in his room and busied himself putting his affairs in order passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs the hours were long for him he listened at his masters door and looked through the keyhole as if he had a perfect right so to do and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment sometimes he thought of fix but no longer in anger fix like all the world had been mistaken in phileas fogg and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him; while he passepartout    this thought haunted him and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly
finding himself too wretched to remain alone he knocked at aoudas door went into her room seated himself without speaking in a corner and looked ruefully at the young woman aouda was still pensive
about half-past seven in the evening mr fogg sent to know if aouda would receive him and in a few moments he found himself alone with her
phileas fogg took a chair and sat down near the fireplace opposite aouda no emotion was visible on his face fogg returned was exactly the fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm the same impassibility
he sat several minutes without speaking; then bending his eyes on aouda madam said he will you pardon me for bringing you to england?
i mr fogg replied aouda checking the pulsations of her heart
please let me finish returned mr fogg when i decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you i was rich and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then your existence would have been free and happy but now i am ruined
i know it mr fogg replied aouda; and i ask you in my turn will you forgive me for having followed you and--who knows?--for having perhaps delayed you and thus contributed to your ruin?
madam you could not remain in india and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you
so mr fogg resumed aouda not content with rescuing me from a terrible death you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land?
yes madam; but circumstances have been against me still i beg to place the little i have left at your service
but what will become of you mr fogg?
as for me madam replied the gentleman coldly i have need of nothing
but how do you look upon the fate sir which awaits you?
as i am in the habit of doing
at least said aouda want should not overtake a man like you your friends--
i have no friends madam your relatives--
i have no longer any relatives
i pity you then mr fogg for solitude is a sad thing with no heart to which to confide your griefs they say though that misery itself shared by two sympathetic souls may be borne with patience
they say so madam mr fogg said aouda rising and seizing his hand do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend? will you have me for your wife?
mr fogg at this rose in his turn there was an unwonted light in his eyes and a slight trembling of his lips aouda looked into his face the sincerity rectitude firmness and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all at first astonished then penetrated him he shut his eyes for an instant as if to avoid her look when he opened them again i love you he said simply yes by all that is holiest i love you and i am entirely yours
ah cried aouda pressing his hand to her heart
passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately mr fogg still held aoudas hand in his own; passepartout understood and his big round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith
mr fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the reverend samuel wilson of marylebone parish that evening
passepartout smiled his most genial smile and said never too late
it was five minutes past eight
will it be for to-morrow monday?
for to-morrow monday said mr fogg turning to aouda
yes; for to-morrow monday she replied
passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him
chapter xxxvi in which phileas foggs name is once more at a premium on change
it is time to relate what a change took place in english public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber a certain james strand had been arrested on the 17th day of december at edinburgh three days before phileas fogg had been a criminal who was being desperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourable gentleman mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world
the papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who had laid bets for or against him revived their interest as if by magic; the phileas fogg bonds again became negotiable and many new wagers were made phileas foggs name was once more at a premium on change
his five friends of the reform club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense would phileas fogg whom they had forgotten reappear before their eyes where was he at this moment? the 17th of december the day of james strands arrest was the seventy-sixth since phileas foggs departure and no news of him had been received was he dead? had he abandoned the effort or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon? and would he appear on saturday the 21st of december at a quarter before nine in the evening on the threshold of the reform club saloon?
the anxiety in which for three days london society existed cannot be described telegrams were sent to america and asia for news of phileas fogg messengers were dispatched to the house in saville row morning and evening no news the police were ignorant what had become of the detective fix who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent bets increased nevertheless in number and value phileas fogg like a racehorse was drawing near his last turning-point the bonds were quoted no longer at a hundred below par but at twenty at ten and at five; and paralytic old lord albemarle bet even in his favour
a great crowd was collected in pall mall and the neighbouring streets on saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the reform club circulation was impeded and everywhere disputes discussions and financial transactions were going on the police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd and as the hour when phileas fogg was due approached the excitement rose to its highest pitch
the five antagonists of phileas fogg had met in the great saloon of the club john sullivan and samuel fallentin the bankers andrew stuart the engineer gauthier ralph the director of the bank of england and thomas flanagan the brewer one and all waited anxiously
when the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight andrew stuart got up saying gentlemen in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between mr fogg and ourselves will have expired
what time did the last train arrive from liverpool? asked thomas flanagan
at twenty-three minutes past seven replied gauthier ralph; and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve
well gentlemen resumed andrew stuart if phileas fogg had come in the 7:23 train he would have got here by this time we can therefore regard the bet as won
wait; dont let us be too hasty replied samuel fallentin you know that mr fogg is very eccentric his punctuality is well known; he never arrives too soon or too late; and i should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute
why said andrew stuart nervously if i should see him i should not believe it was he
the fact is resumed thomas flanagan mr foggs project was absurdly foolish whatever his punctuality he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour
observe too added john sullivan that we have received no intelligence from him though there are telegraphic lines all along his route
he has lost gentleman said andrew stuart he has a hundred times lost you know besides that the china the only steamer he could have taken from new york to get here in time arrived yesterday i have seen a list of the passengers and the name of phileas fogg is not among them even if we admit that fortune has favoured him he can scarcely have reached america i think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand and that lord albemarle will lose a cool five thousand
it is clear replied gauthier ralph; and we have nothing to do but to present mr foggs cheque at barings to-morrow
at this moment the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine
five minutes more said andrew stuart
the five gentlemen looked at each other their anxiety was becoming intense; but not wishing to betray it they readily assented to mr fallentins proposal of a rubber
i wouldnt give up my four thousand of the bet said andrew stuart as he took his seat for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine
the clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine
the players took up their cards but could not keep their eyes off the clock certainly however secure they felt minutes had never seemed so long to them
seventeen minutes to nine said thomas flanagan as he cut the cards which ralph handed to him
then there was a moment of silence the great saloon was perfectly quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard with now and then a shrill cry the pendulum beat the seconds which each player eagerly counted as he listened with mathematical regularity
sixteen minutes to nine said john sullivan in a voice which betrayed his emotion
one minute more and the wager would be won andrew stuart and his partners suspended their game they left their cards and counted the seconds
at the fortieth second nothing at the fiftieth still nothing
at the fifty-fifth a loud cry was heard in the street followed by applause hurrahs and some fierce growls
the players rose from their seats
at the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened; and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when phileas fogg appeared followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club doors and in his calm voice said here i am gentlemen
chapter xxxvii in which it is shown that phileas fogg gained nothing by his tour around the world unless it were happiness
yes; phileas fogg in person the reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the evening--about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in london--passepartout had been sent by his master to engage the services of the reverend samuel wilson in a certain marriage ceremony which was to take place the next day
passepartout went on his errand enchanted he soon reached the clergymans house but found him not at home passepartout waited a good twenty minutes and when he left the reverend gentleman it was thirty-five minutes past eight but in what a state he was with his hair in disorder and without his hat he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before overturning passers-by rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout
in three minutes he was in saville row again and staggered back into mr foggs room
he could not speak what is the matter? asked mr fogg
my master gasped passepartout--marriage--impossible-- impossible? impossible--for to-morrow
why so? because to-morrow--is sunday monday replied mr fogg
no--to-day is saturday saturday? impossible yes yes yes yes cried passepartout you have made a mistake of one day we arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there are only ten minutes left
passepartout had seized his master by the collar and was dragging him along with irresistible force
phileas fogg thus kidnapped without having time to think left his house jumped into a cab promised a hundred pounds to the cabman and having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages reached the reform club
the clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon
phileas fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days
phileas fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds
how was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day? how came he to think that he had arrived in london on saturday the twenty-first day of december when it was really friday the twentieth the seventy-ninth day only from his departure?
the cause of the error is very simple
phileas fogg had without suspecting it gained one day on his journey and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward; he would on the contrary have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction that is westward
in journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction there are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees multiplied by four minutes gives precisely twenty-four hours--that is the day unconsciously gained in other words while phileas fogg going eastward saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times his friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times this is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturday and not sunday as mr fogg thought
and passepartouts famous family watch which had always kept london time would have betrayed this fact if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes
phileas fogg then had won the twenty thousand pounds; but as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way the pecuniary gain was small his object was however to be victorious and not to win money he divided the one thousand pounds that remained between passepartout and the unfortunate fix against whom he cherished no grudge he deducted however from passepartouts share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours for the sake of regularity
that evening mr fogg as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever said to aouda: is our marriage still agreeable to you?
mr fogg replied she it is for me to ask that question you were ruined but now you are rich again
pardon me madam; my fortune belongs to you if you had not suggested our marriage my servant would not have gone to the reverend samuel wilsons i should not have been apprised of my error and--
dear mr fogg said the young woman
dear aouda replied phileas fogg it need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours after and that passepartout glowing and dazzling gave the bride away had he not saved her and was he not entitled to this honour?
the next day as soon as it was light passepartout rapped vigorously at his masters door mr fogg opened it and asked whats the matter passepartout?
what is it sir? why ive just this instant found out--
what? that we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy-eight days
no doubt returned mr fogg by not crossing india but if i had not crossed india i should not have saved aouda; she would not have been my wife and--
mr fogg quietly shut the door
phileas fogg had won his wager and had made his journey around the world in eighty days to do this he had employed every means of conveyance--steamers railways carriages yachts trading-vessels sledges elephants the eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude but what then? what had he really gained by all this trouble? what had he brought back from this long and weary journey?
nothing say you? perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman who strange as it may appear made him the happiest of men
truly would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?
i the eve of the war
no one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than mans and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water with infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs serene in their assurance of their empire over matter it is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same no one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable it is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days at most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon mars perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us and early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment
the planet mars i scarcely need remind the reader revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140000000 miles and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world it must be if the nebular hypothesis has any truth older than our world; and long before this earth ceased to be molten life upon its surface must have begun its course the fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin it has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence
yet so vain is man and so blinded by his vanity that no writer up to the very end of the nineteenth century expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far or indeed at all beyond its earthly level nor was it generally understood that since mars is older than our earth with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from times beginning but nearer its end
the secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour its physical condition is still largely a mystery but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter its air is much more attenuated than ours its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones that last stage of exhaustion which to us is still incredibly remote has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants of mars the immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects enlarged their powers and hardened their hearts and looking across space with instruments and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of they see at its nearest distance only 35000000 of miles sunward of them a morning star of hope our own warmer planet green with vegetation and grey with water with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow navy-crowded seas
and we men the creatures who inhabit this earth must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us the intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon mars their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals to carry warfare sunward is indeed their only escape from the destruction that generation after generation creeps upon them
and before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought not only upon animals such as the vanished bison and the dodo but upon its inferior races the tasmanians in spite of their human likeness were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by european immigrants in the space of fifty years are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the martians warred in the same spirit?
the martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity had our instruments permitted it we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century men like schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd by-the-bye that for countless centuries mars has been the star of war—but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well all that time the martians must have been getting ready
during the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk first at the lick observatory then by perrotin of nice and then by other observers english readers heard of it first in the issue of _nature_ dated august 2 i am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun in the vast pit sunk into their planet from which their shots were fired at us peculiar markings as yet unexplained were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions
the storm burst upon us six years ago now as mars approached opposition lavelle of java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet it had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope to which he had at once resorted indicated a mass of flaming gas chiefly hydrogen moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth this jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve he compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet as flaming gases rushed out of a gun
a singularly appropriate phrase it proved yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _daily telegraph_ and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race i might not have heard of the eruption at all had i not met ogilvy the well-known astronomer at ottershaw he was immensely excited at the news and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet
in spite of all that has happened since i still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope the little slit in the roof—an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it ogilvy moved about invisible but audible looking through the telescope one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round but so little it was so silvery warm—a pins head of light it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view
as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede but that was simply that my eye was tired forty millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of void few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims
near it in the field i remember were three faint points of light three telescopic stars infinitely remote and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space you know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night in a telescope it seems far profounder and invisible to me because it was so remote and small flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles came the thing they were sending us the thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth i never dreamed of it then as i watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile
that night too there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet i saw it a reddish flash at the edge the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that i told ogilvy and he took my place the night was warm and i was thirsty and i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness to the little table where the siphon stood while ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us
that night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from mars just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes i wished i had a light to smoke by little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam i had seen and all that it would presently bring me ogilvy watched till one and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house down below in the darkness were ottershaw and chertsey and all their hundreds of people sleeping in peace
he was full of speculation that night about the condition of mars and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us his idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress he pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets
the chances against anything manlike on mars are a million to one he said
hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight and again the night after; and so for ten nights a flame each night why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth has attempted to explain it may be the gases of the firing caused the martians inconvenience dense clouds of smoke or dust visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey fluctuating patches spread through the clearness of the planets atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last and popular notes appeared here there and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon mars the seriocomic periodical _punch_ i remember made a happy use of it in the political cartoon and all unsuspected those missiles the martians had fired at us drew earthward rushing now at a pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space hour by hour and day by day nearer and nearer it seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that with that swift fate hanging over us men could go about their petty concerns as they did i remember how jubilant markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those days people in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century papers for my own part i was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed
one night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10000000 miles away) i went for a walk with my wife it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her and pointed out mars a bright dot of light creeping zenithward towards which so many telescopes were pointed it was a warm night coming home a party of excursionists from chertsey or isleworth passed us singing and playing music there were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed from the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains ringing and rumbling softened almost into melody by the distance my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky it seemed so safe and tranquil
ii the falling star then came the night of the first falling star it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds denning our greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
i was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my french windows face towards ottershaw and the blind was up (for i loved in those days to look up at the night sky) i saw nothing of it yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have fallen while i was sitting there visible to me had i only looked up as it passed some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound i myself heard nothing of that many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen the fall of it and at most have thought that another meteorite had descended no one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night
but very early in the morning poor ogilvy who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between horsell ottershaw and woking rose early with the idea of finding it find it he did soon after dawn and not far from the sand-pits an enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath forming heaps visible a mile and a half away the heather was on fire eastward and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn
the thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent the uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation it had a diameter of about thirty yards he approached the mass surprised at the size and more so at the shape since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely it was however still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach a stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
he remained standing at the edge of the pit that the thing had made for itself staring at its strange appearance astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival the early morning was wonderfully still and the sun just clearing the pine trees towards weybridge was already warm he did not remember hearing any birds that morning there was certainly no breeze stirring and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder he was all alone on the common
then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite was falling off the circular edge of the end it was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth
for a minute he scarcely realised what this meant and although the heat was excessive he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the thing more clearly he fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder
and then he perceived that very slowly the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body it was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference even then he scarcely understood what this indicated until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so then the thing came upon him in a flash the cylinder was artificial—hollow—with an end that screwed out something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top
good heavens said ogilvy theres a man in it—men in it half roasted to death trying to escape
at once with a quick mental leap he linked the thing with the flash upon mars
the thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn but luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still-glowing metal at that he stood irresolute for a moment then turned scrambled out of the pit and set off running wildly into woking the time then must have been somewhere about six oclock he met a waggoner and tried to make him understand but the tale he told and his appearance were so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that the man simply drove on he was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by horsell bridge the fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom that sobered him a little; and when he saw henderson the london journalist in his garden he called over the palings and made himself understood
henderson he called you saw that shooting star last night?
well? said henderson its out on horsell common now
good lord said henderson fallen meteorite thats good
but its something more than a meteorite its a cylinder—an artificial cylinder man and theres something inside
henderson stood up with his spade in his hand
whats that? he said he was deaf in one ear
ogilvy told him all that he had seen henderson was a minute or so taking it in then he dropped his spade snatched up his jacket and came out into the road the two men hurried back at once to the common and found the cylinder still lying in the same position but now the sounds inside had ceased and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
they listened rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick and meeting with no response they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead
of course the two were quite unable to do anything they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help one can imagine them covered with sand excited and disordered running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows henderson went into the railway station at once in order to telegraph the news to london the newspaper articles had prepared mens minds for the reception of the idea
by eight oclock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the dead men from mars that was the form the story took i heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when i went out to get my _daily chronicle_ i was naturally startled and lost no time in going out and across the ottershaw bridge to the sand-pits
iii on horsell common i found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk embedded in the ground the turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion no doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire henderson and ogilvy were not there i think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present and had gone away to breakfast at hendersons house
there were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the pit with their feet dangling and amusing themselves—until i stopped them—by throwing stones at the giant mass after i had spoken to them about it they began playing at touch in and out of the group of bystanders
among these were a couple of cyclists a jobbing gardener i employed sometimes a girl carrying a baby gregg the butcher and his little boy and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station there was very little talking few of the common people in england had anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days most of them were staring quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder which was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it i fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk some went away while i was there and other people came i clambered into the pit and fancied i heard a faint movement under my feet the top had certainly ceased to rotate
it was only when i got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident to me at the first glance it was really no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road not so much so indeed it looked like a rusty gas float it required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the thing was no common oxide that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue extra-terrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers
at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars but i judged it improbable that it contained any living creature i thought the unscrewing might be automatic in spite of ogilvy i still believed that there were men in mars my mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript on the difficulties in translation that might arise whether we should find coins and models in it and so forth yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea i felt an impatience to see it opened about eleven as nothing seemed happening i walked back full of such thought to my home in maybury but i found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations
in the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much the early editions of the evening papers had startled london with enormous headlines:
a message received from mars remarkable story from woking
and so forth in addition ogilvys wire to the astronomical exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms
there were half a dozen flys or more from the woking station standing in the road by the sand-pits a basket-chaise from chobham and a rather lordly carriage besides that there was quite a heap of bicycles in addition a large number of people must have walked in spite of the heat of the day from woking and chertsey so that there was altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others
it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees the burning heather had been extinguished but the level ground towards ottershaw was blackened as far as one could see and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke an enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the chobham road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger beer
going to the edge of the pit i found it occupied by a group of about half a dozen men—henderson ogilvy and a tall fair-haired man that i afterwards learned was stent the astronomer royal with several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes stent was giving directions in a clear high-pitched voice he was standing on the cylinder which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with perspiration and something seemed to have irritated him
a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered though its lower end was still embedded as soon as ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down and asked me if i would mind going over to see lord hilton the lord of the manor
the growing crowd he said was becoming a serious impediment to their excavations especially the boys they wanted a light railing put up and help to keep the people back he told me that a faint stirring was occasionally still audible within the case but that the workmen had failed to unscrew the top as it afforded no grip to them the case appeared to be enormously thick and it was possible that the faint sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior
i was very glad to do as he asked and so become one of the privileged spectators within the contemplated enclosure i failed to find lord hilton at his house but i was told he was expected from london by the six oclock train from waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter past five i went home had some tea and walked up to the station to waylay him
iv the cylinder opens when i returned to the common the sun was setting scattered groups were hurrying from the direction of woking and one or two persons were returning the crowd about the pit had increased and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people perhaps there were raised voices and some sort of struggle appeared to be going on about the pit strange imaginings passed through my mind as i drew nearer i heard stents voice:
keep back keep back a boy came running towards me
its a-movin he said to me as he passed; a-screwin and a-screwin out i dont like it im a-goin ome i am
i went on to the crowd there were really i should think two or three hundred people elbowing and jostling one another the one or two ladies there being by no means the least active
hes fallen in the pit cried some one
keep back said several the crowd swayed a little and i elbowed my way through every one seemed greatly excited i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
i say said ogilvy; help keep these idiots back we dont know whats in the confounded thing you know
i saw a young man a shop assistant in woking i believe he was standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again the crowd had pushed him in
the end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within nearly two feet of shining screw projected somebody blundered against me and i narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw i turned and as i did so the screw must have come out for the lid of the cylinder fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion i stuck my elbow into the person behind me and turned my head towards the thing again for a moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black i had the sunset in my eyes
i think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men but in all essentials a man i know i did but looking i presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements one above another and then two luminous disks—like eyes then something resembling a little grey snake about the thickness of a walking stick coiled up out of the writhing middle and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another
a sudden chill came over me there was a loud shriek from a woman behind i half turned keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still from which other tentacles were now projecting and began pushing my way back from the edge of the pit i saw astonishment giving place to horror on the faces of the people about me i heard inarticulate exclamations on all sides there was a general movement backwards i saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off stent among them i looked again at the cylinder and ungovernable terror gripped me i stood petrified and staring
a big greyish rounded bulk the size perhaps of a bear was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder as it bulged up and caught the light it glistened like wet leather
two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly the mass that framed them the head of the thing was rounded and had one might say a face there was a mouth under the eyes the lipless brim of which quivered and panted and dropped saliva the whole creature heaved and pulsated convulsively a lank tentacular appendage gripped the edge of the cylinder another swayed in the air
those who have never seen a living martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance the peculiar v-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip the absence of brow ridges the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip the incessant quivering of this mouth the gorgon groups of tentacles the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above all the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once vital intense inhuman crippled and monstrous there was something fungoid in the oily brown skin something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty even at this first encounter this first glimpse i was overcome with disgust and dread
suddenly the monster vanished it had toppled over the brim of the cylinder and fallen into the pit with a thud like the fall of a great mass of leather i heard it give a peculiar thick cry and forthwith another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the aperture
i turned and running madly made for the first group of trees perhaps a hundred yards away; but i ran slantingly and stumbling for i could not avert my face from these things
there among some young pine trees and furze bushes i stopped panting and waited further developments the common round the sand-pits was dotted with people standing like myself in a half-fascinated terror staring at these creatures or rather at the heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay and then with a renewed horror i saw a round black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit it was the head of the shopman who had fallen in but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun now he got his shoulder and knee up and again he seemed to slip back until only his head was visible suddenly he vanished and i could have fancied a faint shriek had reached me i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him that my fears overruled
everything was then quite invisible hidden by the deep pit and the heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made anyone coming along the road from chobham or woking would have been amazed at the sight—a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more standing in a great irregular circle in ditches behind bushes behind gates and hedges saying little to one another and that in short excited shouts and staring staring hard at a few heaps of sand the barrow of ginger beer stood a queer derelict black against the burning sky and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground
v the heat-ray after the glimpse i had had of the martians emerging from the cylinder in which they had come to the earth from their planet a kind of fascination paralysed my actions i remained standing knee-deep in the heather staring at the mound that hid them i was a battleground of fear and curiosity
i did not dare to go back towards the pit but i felt a passionate longing to peer into it i began walking therefore in a big curve seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps that hid these new-comers to our earth once a leash of thin black whips like the arms of an octopus flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn and afterwards a thin rod rose up joint by joint bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion what could be going on there?
most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little crowd towards woking the other a knot of people in the direction of chobham evidently they shared my mental conflict there were few near me one man i approached—he was i perceived a neighbour of mine though i did not know his name—and accosted but it was scarcely a time for articulate conversation
what ugly _brutes_ he said good god what ugly brutes he repeated this over and over again
did you see a man in the pit? i said; but he made no answer to that we became silent and stood watching for a time side by side deriving i fancy a certain comfort in one anothers company then i shifted my position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more of elevation and when i looked for him presently he was walking towards woking
the sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened the crowd far away on the left towards woking seemed to grow and i heard now a faint murmur from it the little knot of people towards chobham dispersed there was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit
it was this as much as anything that gave people courage and i suppose the new arrivals from woking also helped to restore confidence at any rate as the dusk came on a slow intermittent movement upon the sand-pits began a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance stop watch and advance again spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns i too on my side began to move towards the pit
then i saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels i saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples and then within thirty yards of the pit advancing from the direction of horsell i noted a little black knot of men the foremost of whom was waving a white flag
this was the deputation there had been a hasty consultation and since the martians were evidently in spite of their repulsive forms intelligent creatures it had been resolved to show them by approaching them with signals that we too were intelligent
flutter flutter went the flag first to the right then to the left it was too far for me to recognise anyone there but afterwards i learned that ogilvy stent and henderson were with others in this attempt at communication this little group had in its advance dragged inward so to speak the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances
suddenly there was a flash of light and a quantity of luminous greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs which drove up one after the other straight into the still air
this smoke (or flame perhaps would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards chertsey set with black pine trees seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose and to remain the darker after their dispersal at the same time a faint hissing sound became audible
beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex arrested by these phenomena a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground as the green smoke arose their faces flashed out pallid green and faded again as it vanished then slowly the hissing passed into a humming into a long loud droning noise slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit and the ghost of a beam of light seemed to flicker out from it
forthwith flashes of actual flame a bright glare leaping from one to another sprang from the scattered group of men it was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame it was as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire
then by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
i stood staring not as yet realising that this was death leaping from man to man in that little distant crowd all i felt was that it was something very strange an almost noiseless and blinding flash of light and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft of heat passed over them pine trees burst into fire and every dry furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames and far away towards knaphill i saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden buildings suddenly set alight
it was sweeping round swiftly and steadily this flaming death this invisible inevitable sword of heat i perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched and was too astounded and stupefied to stir i heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled then it was as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the martians and all along a curving line beyond the sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled something fell with a crash far away to the left where the road from woking station opens out on the common forth-with the hissing and humming ceased and the black dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit
all this had happened with such swiftness that i had stood motionless dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light had that death swept through a full circle it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise but it passed and spared me and left the night about me suddenly dark and unfamiliar
the undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night it was dark and suddenly void of men overhead the stars were mustering and in the west the sky was still a pale bright almost greenish blue the tops of the pine trees and the roofs of horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow the martians and their appliances were altogether invisible save for that thin mast upon which their restless mirror wobbled patches of bush and isolated trees here and there smoked and glowed still and the houses towards woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of the evening air
nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment the little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence and the stillness of the evening so it seemed to me had scarcely been broken
it came to me that i was upon this dark common helpless unprotected and alone suddenly like a thing falling upon me from without came—fear
with an effort i turned and began a stumbling run through the heather
the fear i felt was no rational fear but a panic terror not only of the martians but of the dusk and stillness all about me such an extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that i ran weeping silently as a child might do once i had turned i did not dare to look back
i remember i felt an extraordinary persuasion that i was being played with that presently when i was upon the very verge of safety this mysterious death—as swift as the passage of light—would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down
vi the heat-ray in the chobham road
it is still a matter of wonder how the martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity this intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light but no one has absolutely proved these details however it is done it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter heat and invisible instead of visible light whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch lead runs like water it softens iron cracks and melts glass and when it falls upon water incontinently that explodes into steam
that night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit charred and distorted beyond recognition and all night long the common from horsell to maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze
the news of the massacre probably reached chobham woking and ottershaw about the same time in woking the shops had closed when the tragedy happened and a number of people shop people and so forth attracted by the stories they had heard were walking over the horsell bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon the common you may imagine the young people brushed up after the labours of the day and making this novelty as they would make any novelty the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial flirtation you may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road in the gloaming   
as yet of course few people in woking even knew that the cylinder had opened though poor henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the post office with a special wire to an evening paper
as these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open they found little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning mirror over the sand-pits and the newcomers were no doubt soon infected by the excitement of the occasion
by half past eight when the deputation was destroyed there may have been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place besides those who had left the road to approach the martians nearer there were three policemen too one of whom was mounted doing their best under instructions from stent to keep the people back and deter them from approaching the cylinder there was some booing from those more thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion for noise and horse-play
stent and ogilvy anticipating some possibilities of a collision had telegraphed from horsell to the barracks as soon as the martians emerged for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange creatures from violence after that they returned to lead that ill-fated advance the description of their death as it was seen by the crowd tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three puffs of green smoke the deep humming note and the flashes of flame
but that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine only the fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the heat-ray saved them had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a few yards higher none could have lived to tell the tale they saw the flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand as it were lit the bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight then with a whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit the beam swung close over their heads lighting the tops of the beech trees that line the road and splitting the bricks smashing the windows firing the window frames and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the gable of the house nearest the corner
in the sudden thud hiss and glare of the igniting trees the panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some moments sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road and single leaves like puffs of flame hats and dresses caught fire then came a crying from the common there were shrieks and shouts and suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with his hands clasped over his head screaming
theyre coming a woman shrieked and incontinently everyone was turning and pushing at those behind in order to clear their way to woking again they must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed and a desperate struggle occurred all that crowd did not escape; three persons at least two women and a little boy were crushed and trampled there and left to die amid the terror and the darkness
vii how i reached home for my own part i remember nothing of my flight except the stress of blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather all about me gathered the invisible terrors of the martians; that pitiless sword of heat seemed whirling to and fro flourishing overhead before it descended and smote me out of life i came into the road between the crossroads and horsell and ran along this to the crossroads
at last i could go no further; i was exhausted with the violence of my emotion and of my flight and i staggered and fell by the wayside that was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks i fell and lay still
i must have remained there some time
i sat up strangely perplexed for a moment perhaps i could not clearly understand how i came there my terror had fallen from me like a garment my hat had gone and my collar had burst away from its fastener a few minutes before there had only been three real things before me—the immensity of the night and space and nature my own feebleness and anguish and the near approach of death now it was as if something turned over and the point of view altered abruptly there was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other i was immediately the self of every day again—a decent ordinary citizen the silent common the impulse of my flight the starting flames were as if they had been in a dream i asked myself had these latter things indeed happened? i could not credit it
i rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge my mind was blank wonder my muscles and nerves seemed drained of their strength i dare say i staggered drunkenly a head rose over the arch and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared beside him ran a little boy he passed me wishing me good night i was minded to speak to him but did not i answered his greeting with a meaningless mumble and went on over the bridge
over the maybury arch a train a billowing tumult of white firelit smoke and a long caterpillar of lighted windows went flying south—clatter clatter clap rap and it had gone a dim group of people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row of gables that was called oriental terrace it was all so real and so familiar and that behind me it was frantic fantastic such things i told myself could not be
perhaps i am a man of exceptional moods i do not know how far my experience is common at times i suffer from the strangest sense of detachment from myself and the world about me; i seem to watch it all from the outside from somewhere inconceivably remote out of time out of space out of the stress and tragedy of it all this feeling was very strong upon me that night here was another side to my dream
but the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the swift death flying yonder not two miles away there was a noise of business from the gasworks and the electric lamps were all alight i stopped at the group of people
what news from the common? said i
there were two men and a woman at the gate
eh? said one of the men turning
what news from the common? i said
aint yer just _been_ there? asked the men
people seem fair silly about the common said the woman over the gate whats it all abart?
havent you heard of the men from mars? said i; the creatures from mars?
quite enough said the woman over the gate thenks; and all three of them laughed
i felt foolish and angry i tried and found i could not tell them what i had seen they laughed again at my broken sentences
youll hear more yet i said and went on to my home
i startled my wife at the doorway so haggard was i i went into the dining room sat down drank some wine and so soon as i could collect myself sufficiently i told her the things i had seen the dinner which was a cold one had already been served and remained neglected on the table while i told my story
there is one thing i said to allay the fears i had aroused; they are the most sluggish things i ever saw crawl they may keep the pit and kill people who come near them but they cannot get out of it    but the horror of them
dont dear said my wife knitting her brows and putting her hand on mine
poor ogilvy i said to think he may be lying dead there
my wife at least did not find my experience incredible when i saw how deadly white her face was i ceased abruptly
they may come here she said again and again
i pressed her to take wine and tried to reassure her
they can scarcely move i said
i began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that ogilvy had told me of the impossibility of the martians establishing themselves on the earth in particular i laid stress on the gravitational difficulty on the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is on the surface of mars a martian therefore would weigh three times more than on mars albeit his muscular strength would be the same his own body would be a cope of lead to him therefore that indeed was the general opinion both _the times_ and the _daily telegraph_ for instance insisted on it the next morning and both overlooked just as i did two obvious modifying influences
the atmosphere of the earth we now know contains far more oxygen or far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does mars the invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the martians indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their bodies and in the second place we all overlooked the fact that such mechanical intelligence as the martian possessed was quite able to dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch
but i did not consider these points at the time and so my reasoning was dead against the chances of the invaders with wine and food the confidence of my own table and the necessity of reassuring my wife i grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure
they have done a foolish thing said i fingering my wineglass they are dangerous because no doubt they are mad with terror perhaps they expected to find no living things—certainly no intelligent living things
a shell in the pit said i if the worst comes to the worst will kill them all
the intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive powers in a state of erethism i remember that dinner table with extraordinary vividness even now my dear wifes sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass are photographically distinct at the end of it i sat tempering nuts with a cigarette regretting ogilvys rashness and denouncing the short-sighted timidity of the martians
so some respectable dodo in the mauritius might have lorded it in his nest and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in want of animal food we will peck them to death tomorrow my dear
i did not know it but that was the last civilised dinner i was to eat for very many strange and terrible days
viii friday night the most extraordinary thing to my mind of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that friday was the dovetailing of the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong if on friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the woking sand-pits i doubt if you would have had one human being outside it unless it were some relation of stent or of the three or four cyclists or london people lying dead on the common whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the new-comers many people had heard of the cylinder of course and talked about it in their leisure but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to germany would have done
in london that night poor hendersons telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard and his evening paper after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply—the man was killed—decided not to print a special edition
even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were inert i have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom i spoke all over the district people were dining and supping; working men were gardening after the labours of the day children were being put to bed young people were wandering through the lanes love-making students sat over their books
maybe there was a murmur in the village streets a novel and dominant topic in the public-houses and here and there a messenger or even an eye-witness of the later occurrences caused a whirl of excitement a shouting and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily routine of working eating drinking sleeping went on as it had done for countless years—as though no planet mars existed in the sky even at woking station and horsell and chobham that was the case
in woking junction until a late hour trains were stopping and going on others were shunting on the sidings passengers were alighting and waiting and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way a boy from the town trenching on smiths monopoly was selling papers with the afternoons news the ringing impact of trucks the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction mingled with their shouts of men from mars excited men came into the station about nine oclock with incredible tidings and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might have done people rattling londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows and saw only a rare flickering vanishing spark dance up from the direction of horsell a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening it was only round the edge of the common that any disturbance was perceptible there were half a dozen villas burning on the woking border there were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages and the people there kept awake till dawn
a curious crowd lingered restlessly people coming and going but the crowd remaining both on the chobham and horsell bridges one or two adventurous souls it was afterwards found went into the darkness and crawled quite near the martians; but they never returned for now and again a light-ray like the beam of a warships searchlight swept the common and the heat-ray was ready to follow save for such that big area of common was silent and desolate and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars and all the next day a noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people
so you have the state of things on friday night in the centre sticking into the skin of our old planet earth like a poisoned dart was this cylinder but the poison was scarcely working yet around it was a patch of silent common smouldering in places and with a few dark dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there here and there was a burning bush or tree beyond was a fringe of excitement and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet in the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years the fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery deaden nerve and destroy brain had still to develop
all night long the martians were hammering and stirring sleepless indefatigable at work upon the machines they were making ready and ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit sky
about eleven a company of soldiers came through horsell and deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon later a second company marched through chobham to deploy on the north side of the common several officers from the inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier in the day and one major eden was reported to be missing the colonel of the regiment came to the chobham bridge and was busy questioning the crowd at midnight the military authorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business about eleven the next mornings papers were able to say a squadron of hussars two maxims and about four hundred men of the cardigan regiment started from aldershot
a few seconds after midnight the crowd in the chertsey road woking saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest it had a greenish colour and caused a silent brightness like summer lightning this was the second cylinder
ix the fighting begins saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense it was a day of lassitude too hot and close with i am told a rapidly fluctuating barometer i had slept but little though my wife had succeeded in sleeping and i rose early i went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark
the milkman came as usual i heard the rattle of his chariot and i went round to the side gate to ask the latest news he told me that during the night the martians had been surrounded by troops and that guns were expected then—a familiar reassuring note—i heard a train running towards woking
they arent to be killed said the milkman if that can possibly be avoided
i saw my neighbour gardening chatted with him for a time and then strolled in to breakfast it was a most unexceptional morning my neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the martians during the day
its a pity they make themselves so unapproachable he said it would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might learn a thing or two
he came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic at the same time he told me of the burning of the pine woods about the byfleet golf links
they say said he that theres another of those blessed things fallen there—number two but ones enough surely this lotll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before everythings settled he laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this the woods he said were still burning and pointed out a haze of smoke to me they will be hot under foot for days on account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf he said and then grew serious over poor ogilvy
after breakfast instead of working i decided to walk down towards the common under the railway bridge i found a group of soldiers—sappers i think men in small round caps dirty red jackets unbuttoned and showing their blue shirts dark trousers and boots coming to the calf they told me no one was allowed over the canal and looking along the road towards the bridge i saw one of the cardigan men standing sentinel there i talked with these soldiers for a time; i told them of my sight of the martians on the previous evening none of them had seen the martians and they had but the vaguest ideas of them so that they plied me with questions they said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute had arisen at the horse guards the ordinary sapper is a great deal better educated than the common soldier and they discussed the peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness i described the heat-ray to them and they began to argue among themselves
crawl up under cover and rush em say i said one
get aht said another whats cover against this ere eat? sticks to cook yer what we got to do is to go as near as the groundll let us and then drive a trench
blow yer trenches you always want trenches; you ought to ha been born a rabbit snippy
aint they got any necks then? said a third abruptly—a little contemplative dark man smoking a pipe
i repeated my description octopuses said he thats what i calls em talk about fishers of men—fighters of fish it is this time
it aint no murder killing beasts like that said the first speaker
why not shell the darned things strite off and finish em? said the little dark man you carn tell what they might do
wheres your shells? said the first speaker there aint no time do it in a rush thats my tip and do it at once
so they discussed it after a while i left them and went on to the railway station to get as many morning papers as i could
but i will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning and of the longer afternoon i did not succeed in getting a glimpse of the common for even horsell and chobham church towers were in the hands of the military authorities the soldiers i addressed didnt know anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy i found people in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military and i heard for the first time from marshall the tobacconist that his son was among the dead on the common the soldiers had made the people on the outskirts of horsell lock up and leave their houses
i got back to lunch about two very tired for as i have said the day was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself i took a cold bath in the afternoon about half past four i went up to the railway station to get an evening paper for the morning papers had contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of stent henderson ogilvy and the others but there was little i didnt know the martians did not show an inch of themselves they seemed busy in their pit and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous streamer of smoke apparently they were busy getting ready for a struggle fresh attempts have been made to signal but without success was the stereotyped formula of the papers a sapper told me it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole the martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the lowing of a cow
i must confess the sight of all this armament all this preparation greatly excited me my imagination became belligerent and defeated the invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of battle and heroism came back it hardly seemed a fair fight to me at that time they seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs
about three oclock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals from chertsey or addlestone i learned that the smouldering pine wood into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled in the hope of destroying that object before it opened it was only about five however that a field gun reached chobham for use against the first body of martians
about six in the evening as i sat at tea with my wife in the summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon us i heard a muffled detonation from the common and immediately after a gust of firing close on the heels of that came a violent rattling crash quite close to us that shook the ground; and starting out upon the lawn i saw the tops of the trees about the oriental college burst into smoky red flame and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin the pinnacle of the mosque had vanished and the roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been at work upon it one of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it flew and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window
i and my wife stood amazed then i realised that the crest of maybury hill must be within range of the martians heat-ray now that the college was cleared out of the way
at that i gripped my wifes arm and without ceremony ran her out into the road then i fetched out the servant telling her i would go upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for
we cant possibly stay here i said; and as i spoke the firing reopened for a moment upon the common
but where are we to go? said my wife in terror
i thought perplexed then i remembered her cousins at leatherhead
leatherhead i shouted above the sudden noise
she looked away from me downhill the people were coming out of their houses astonished
how are we to get to leatherhead? she said
down the hill i saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge; three galloped through the open gates of the oriental college; two others dismounted and began running from house to house the sun shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees seemed blood red and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything
stop here said i; you are safe here; and i started off at once for the spotted dog for i knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart i ran for i perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving i found him in his bar quite unaware of what was going on behind his house a man stood with his back to me talking to him
i must have a pound said the landlord and ive no one to drive it
ill give you two said i over the strangers shoulder
what for? and ill bring it back by midnight i said
lord said the landlord; whats the hurry? im selling my bit of a pig two pounds and you bring it back? whats going on now?
i explained hastily that i had to leave my home and so secured the dog cart at the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his i took care to have the cart there and then drove it off down the road and leaving it in charge of my wife and servant rushed into my house and packed a few valuables such plate as we had and so forth the beech trees below the house were burning while i did this and the palings up the road glowed red while i was occupied in this way one of the dismounted hussars came running up he was going from house to house warning people to leave he was going on as i came out of my front door lugging my treasures done up in a tablecloth i shouted after him:
what news? he turned stared bawled something about crawling out in a thing like a dish cover and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest a sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment i ran to my neighbours door and rapped to satisfy myself of what i already knew that his wife had gone to london with him and had locked up their house i went in again according to my promise to get my servants box lugged it out clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart and then caught the reins and jumped up into the drivers seat beside my wife in another moment we were clear of the smoke and noise and spanking down the opposite slope of maybury hill towards old woking
in front was a quiet sunny landscape a wheat field ahead on either side of the road and the maybury inn with its swinging sign i saw the doctors cart ahead of me at the bottom of the hill i turned my head to look at the hillside i was leaving thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward the smoke already extended far away to the east and west—to the byfleet pine woods eastward and to woking on the west the road was dotted with people running towards us and very faint now but very distinct through the hot quiet air one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that was presently stilled and an intermittent cracking of rifles apparently the martians were setting fire to everything within range of their heat-ray
i am not an expert driver and i had immediately to turn my attention to the horse when i looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke i slashed the horse with the whip and gave him a loose rein until woking and send lay between us and that quivering tumult i overtook and passed the doctor between woking and send
x in the storm leatherhead is about twelve miles from maybury hill the scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond pyrford and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses the heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down maybury hill ceased as abruptly as it began leaving the evening very peaceful and still we got to leatherhead without misadventure about nine oclock and the horse had an hours rest while i took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care
my wife was curiously silent throughout the drive and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil i talked to her reassuringly pointing out that the martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper she would i think have urged me to stay in leatherhead that night would that i had her face i remember was very white as we parted
for my own part i had been feverishly excited all day something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood and in my heart i was not so very sorry that i had to return to maybury that night i was even afraid that that last fusillade i had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from mars i can best express my state of mind by saying that i wanted to be in at the death
it was nearly eleven when i started to return the night was unexpectedly dark; to me walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins house it seemed indeed black and it was as hot and close as the day overhead the clouds were driving fast albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us my cousins man lit both lamps happily i knew the road intimately my wife stood in the light of the doorway and watched me until i jumped up into the dog cart then abruptly she turned and went in leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap
i was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wifes fears but very soon my thoughts reverted to the martians at that time i was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evenings fighting i did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated the conflict as i came through ockham (for that was the way i returned and not through send and old woking) i saw along the western horizon a blood-red glow which as i drew nearer crept slowly up the sky the driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke
ripley street was deserted and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life; but i narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to pyrford where a knot of people stood with their backs to me they said nothing to me as i passed i do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill nor do i know if the silent houses i passed on my way were sleeping securely or deserted and empty or harassed and watching against the terror of the night
from ripley until i came through pyrford i was in the valley of the wey and the red glare was hidden from me as i ascended the little hill beyond pyrford church the glare came into view again and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me then i heard midnight pealing out from pyrford church behind me and then came the silhouette of maybury hill with its tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red
even as i beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards addlestone i felt a tug at the reins i saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left it was the third falling star
close on its apparition and blindingly violet by contrast danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead the horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted
a moderate incline runs towards the foot of maybury hill and down this we clattered once the lightning had begun it went on in as rapid a succession of flashes as i have ever seen the thunderclaps treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations the flickering light was blinding and confusing and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as i drove down the slope
at first i regarded little but the road before me and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of maybury hill at first i took it for the wet roof of a house but one flash following another showed it to be in swift rolling movement it was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering darkness and then in a flash like daylight the red masses of the orphanage near the crest of the hill the green tops of the pine trees and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright
and this thing i saw how can i describe it? a monstrous tripod higher than many houses striding over the young pine trees and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder a flash and it came out vividly heeling over one way with two feet in the air to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed with the next flash a hundred yards nearer can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? that was the impression those instant flashes gave but instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand
then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were snapped off and driven headlong and a second huge tripod appeared rushing as it seemed headlong towards me and i was galloping hard to meet it at the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether not stopping to look again i wrenched the horses head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily and i was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water
i crawled out almost immediately and crouched my feet still in the water under a clump of furze the horse lay motionless (his neck was broken poor brute) and by the lightning flashes i saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly in another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me and passed uphill towards pyrford
seen nearer the thing was incredibly strange for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way machine it was with a ringing metallic pace and long flexible glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange body it picked its road as it went striding along and the brazen hood that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fishermans basket and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me and in an instant it was gone
so much i saw then all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning in blinding highlights and dense black shadows
as it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunder—aloo aloo—and in another minute it was with its companion half a mile away stooping over something in the field i have no doubt this thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from mars
for some minutes i lay there in the rain and darkness watching by the intermittent light these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops a thin hail was now beginning and as it came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again now and then came a gap in the lightning and the night swallowed them up
i was soaked with hail above and puddle water below it was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a drier position or think at all of my imminent peril
not far from me was a little one-roomed squatters hut of wood surrounded by a patch of potato garden i struggled to my feet at last and crouching and making use of every chance of cover i made a run for this i hammered at the door but i could not make the people hear (if there were any people inside) and after a time i desisted and availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way succeeded in crawling unobserved by these monstrous machines into the pine woods towards maybury
under cover of this i pushed on wet and shivering now towards my own house i walked among the trees trying to find the footpath it was very dark indeed in the wood for the lightning was now becoming infrequent and the hail which was pouring down in a torrent fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage
if i had fully realised the meaning of all the things i had seen i should have immediately worked my way round through byfleet to street cobham and so gone back to rejoin my wife at leatherhead but that night the strangeness of things about me and my physical wretchedness prevented me for i was bruised weary wet to the skin deafened and blinded by the storm
i had a vague idea of going on to my own house and that was as much motive as i had i staggered through the trees fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the college arms i say splashed for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent there in the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back
he gave a cry of terror sprang sideways and rushed on before i could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him so heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that i had the hardest task to win my way up the hill i went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way along its palings
near the top i stumbled upon something soft and by a flash of lightning saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots before i could distinguish clearly how the man lay the flicker of light had passed i stood over him waiting for the next flash when it came i saw that he was a sturdy man cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body and he lay crumpled up close to the fence as though he had been flung violently against it
overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body i stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart he was quite dead apparently his neck had been broken the lightning flashed for a third time and his face leaped upon me i sprang to my feet it was the landlord of the spotted dog whose conveyance i had taken
i stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill i made my way by the police station and the college arms towards my own house nothing was burning on the hillside though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail so far as i could see by the flashes the houses about me were mostly uninjured by the college arms a dark heap lay in the road
down the road towards maybury bridge there were voices and the sound of feet but i had not the courage to shout or to go to them i let myself in with my latchkey closed locked and bolted the door staggered to the foot of the staircase and sat down my imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters and of the dead body smashed against the fence
i crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall shivering violently
xi at the window i have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves after a time i discovered that i was cold and wet and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet i got up almost mechanically went into the dining room and drank some whisky and then i was moved to change my clothes
after i had done that i went upstairs to my study but why i did so i do not know the window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards horsell common in the hurry of our departure this window had been left open the passage was dark and by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark i stopped short in the doorway
the thunderstorm had passed the towers of the oriental college and the pine trees about it had gone and very far away lit by a vivid red glare the common about the sand-pits was visible across the light huge black shapes grotesque and strange moved busily to and fro
it seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame swaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud scud above every now and then a haze of smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid the martian shapes i could not see what they were doing nor the clear form of them nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon neither could i see the nearer fire though the reflections of it danced on the wall and ceiling of the study a sharp resinous tang of burning was in the air
i closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window as i did so the view opened out until on the one hand it reached to the houses about woking station and on the other to the charred and blackened pine woods of byfleet there was a light down below the hill on the railway near the arch and several of the houses along the maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins the light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and a vivid glare and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs then i perceived this was a wrecked train the fore part smashed and on fire the hinder carriages still upon the rails
between these three main centres of light—the houses the train and the burning county towards chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark country broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and smoking ground it was the strangest spectacle that black expanse set with fire it reminded me more than anything else of the potteries at night at first i could distinguish no people at all though i peered intently for them later i saw against the light of woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line
and this was the little world in which i had been living securely for years this fiery chaos what had happened in the last seven hours i still did not know; nor did i know though i was beginning to guess the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps i had seen disgorged from the cylinder with a queer feeling of impersonal interest i turned my desk chair to the window sat down and stared at the blackened country and particularly at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand-pits
they seemed amazingly busy i began to ask myself what they could be were they intelligent mechanisms? such a thing i felt was impossible or did a martian sit within each ruling directing using much as a mans brain sits and rules in his body? i began to compare the things to human machines to ask myself for the first time in my life how an ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal
the storm had left the sky clear and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading pinpoint of mars was dropping into the west when a soldier came into my garden i heard a slight scraping at the fence and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me i looked down and saw him dimly clambering over the palings at the sight of another human being my torpor passed and i leaned out of the window eagerly
hist said i in a whisper
he stopped astride of the fence in doubt then he came over and across the lawn to the corner of the house he bent down and stepped softly
whos there? he said also whispering standing under the window and peering up
where are you going? i asked
god knows are you trying to hide?
thats it come into the house i said
i went down unfastened the door and let him in and locked the door again i could not see his face he was hatless and his coat was unbuttoned
my god he said as i drew him in
what has happened? i asked what hasnt? in the obscurity i could see he made a gesture of despair they wiped us out—simply wiped us out he repeated again and again
he followed me almost mechanically into the dining room
take some whisky i said pouring out a stiff dose
he drank it then abruptly he sat down before the table put his head on his arms and began to sob and weep like a little boy in a perfect passion of emotion while i with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair stood beside him wondering
it was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly he was a driver in the artillery and had only come into action about seven at that time firing was going on across the common and it was said the first party of martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield
later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of the fighting-machines i had seen the gun he drove had been unlimbered near horsell in order to command the sand-pits and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action as the limber gunners went to the rear his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down throwing him into a depression of the ground at the same moment the gun exploded behind him the ammunition blew up there was fire all about him and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses
i lay still he said scared out of my wits with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me wed been wiped out and the smell—good god like burnt meat i was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse and there i had to lie until i felt better just like parade it had been a minute before—then stumble bang swish
wiped out he said he had hid under the dead horse for a long time peeping out furtively across the common the cardigan men had tried a rush in skirmishing order at the pit simply to be swept out of existence then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being a kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case about which green flashes scintillated and out of the funnel of this there smoked the heat-ray
in a few minutes there was so far as the soldier could see not a living thing left upon the common and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning the hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground and he saw nothing of them he heard the maxims rattle for a time and then become still the giant saved woking station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the heat-ray was brought to bear and the town became a heap of fiery ruins then the thing shut off the heat-ray and turning its back upon the artilleryman began to waddle away towards the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder as it did so a second glittering titan built itself up out of the pit
the second monster followed the first and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards horsell he managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the road and so escaped to woking there his story became ejaculatory the place was impassable it seems there were a few people alive there frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded he was turned aside by the fire and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the martian giants returned he saw this one pursue a man catch him up in one of its steely tentacles and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree at last after nightfall the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment
since then he had been skulking along towards maybury in the hope of getting out of danger londonward people were hiding in trenches and cellars and many of the survivors had made off towards woking village and send he had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway arch smashed and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road
that was the story i got from him bit by bit he grew calmer telling me and trying to make me see the things he had seen he had eaten no food since midday he told me early in his narrative and i found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room we lit no lamp for fear of attracting the martians and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat as he talked things about us came darkly out of the darkness and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct it would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn i began to see his face blackened and haggard as no doubt mine was also
when we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study and i looked again out of the open window in one night the valley had become a valley of ashes the fires had dwindled now where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white railway signal here the end of a greenhouse there white and fresh amid the wreckage never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal and shining with the growing light of the east three of the metallic giants stood about the pit their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made
it seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawn—streamed up whirled broke and vanished
beyond were the pillars of fire about chobham they became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day
xii what i saw of the destruction of weybridge and shepperton
as the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the martians and went very quietly downstairs
the artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in he proposed he said to make his way londonward and thence rejoin his battery—no 12 of the horse artillery my plan was to return at once to leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the martians impressed me that i had determined to take my wife to newhaven and go with her out of the country forthwith for i already perceived clearly that the country about london must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed
between us and leatherhead however lay the third cylinder with its guarding giants had i been alone i think i should have taken my chance and struck across country but the artilleryman dissuaded me: its no kindness to the right sort of wife he said to make her a widow; and in the end i agreed to go with him under cover of the woods northward as far as street cobham before i parted with him thence i would make a big detour by epsom to reach leatherhead
i should have started at once but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that he made me ransack the house for a flask which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat then we crept out of the house and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which i had come overnight the houses seemed deserted in the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together struck dead by the heat-ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a clock a slipper a silver spoon and the like poor valuables at the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart filled with boxes and furniture and horseless heeled over on a broken wheel a cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris
except the lodge at the orphanage which was still on fire none of the houses had suffered very greatly here the heat-ray had shaved the chimney tops and passed yet save ourselves there did not seem to be a living soul on maybury hill the majority of the inhabitants had escaped i suppose by way of the old woking road—the road i had taken when i drove to leatherhead—or they had hidden
we went down the lane by the body of the man in black sodden now from the overnight hail and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill we pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul the woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen but a certain proportion still stood dismal grey stems with dark brown foliage instead of green
on our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing in one place the woodmen had been at work on saturday; trees felled and freshly trimmed lay in a clearing with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine hard by was a temporary hut deserted there was not a breath of wind this morning and everything was strangely still even the birds were hushed and as we hurried along i and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders once or twice we stopped to listen
after a time we drew near the road and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers riding slowly towards woking we hailed them and they halted while we hurried towards them it was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th hussars with a stand like a theodolite which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph
you are the first men ive seen coming this way this morning said the lieutenant whats brewing?
his voice and face were eager the men behind him stared curiously the artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted
gun destroyed last night sir have been hiding trying to rejoin battery sir youll come in sight of the martians i expect about half a mile along this road
what the dickens are they like? asked the lieutenant
giants in armour sir hundred feet high three legs and a body like luminium with a mighty great head in a hood sir
get out said the lieutenant what confounded nonsense
youll see sir they carry a kind of box sir that shoots fire and strikes you dead
what dye mean—a gun? no sir and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the heat-ray halfway through the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me i was still standing on the bank by the side of the road
its perfectly true i said well said the lieutenant i suppose its my business to see it too look here—to the artilleryman—were detailed here clearing people out of their houses youd better go along and report yourself to brigadier-general marvin and tell him all you know hes at weybridge know the way?
i do i said; and he turned his horse southward again
half a mile you say? said he
at most i answered and pointed over the treetops southward he thanked me and rode on and we saw them no more
farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in the road busy clearing out a labourers cottage they had got hold of a little hand truck and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles and shabby furniture they were all too assiduously engaged to talk to us as we passed
by byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees and found the country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight we were far beyond the range of the heat-ray there and had it not been for the silent desertion of some of the houses the stirring movement of packing in others and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over the railway and staring down the line towards woking the day would have seemed very like any other sunday
several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to addlestone and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw across a stretch of flat meadow six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal distances pointing towards woking the gunners stood by the guns waiting and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance the men stood almost as if under inspection
thats good said i they will get one fair shot at any rate
the artilleryman hesitated at the gate
i shall go on he said
farther on towards weybridge just over the bridge there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart and more guns behind
its bows and arrows against the lightning anyhow said the artilleryman they avent seen that fire-beam yet
the officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction
byfleet was in a tumult; people packing and a score of hussars some of them dismounted some on horseback were hunting them about three or four black government waggons with crosses in white circles and an old omnibus among other vehicles were being loaded in the village street there were scores of people most of them sufficiently sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes the soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position we saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind i stopped and gripped his arm
do you know whats over there? i said pointing at the pine tops that hid the martians
eh? said he turning i was explainin these is vallyble
death i shouted death is coming death and leaving him to digest that if he could i hurried on after the artillery-man at the corner i looked back the soldier had left him and he was still standing by his box with the pots of orchids on the lid of it and staring vaguely over the trees
no one in weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established; the whole place was in such confusion as i had never seen in any town before carts carriages everywhere the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh the respectable inhabitants of the place men in golf and boating costumes wives prettily dressed were packing river-side loafers energetically helping children excited and for the most part highly delighted at this astonishing variation of their sunday experiences in the midst of it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration and his bell was jangling out above the excitement
i and the artilleryman seated on the step of the drinking fountain made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us patrols of soldiers—here no longer hussars but grenadiers in white—were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began we saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages the ordinary traffic had been stopped i believe in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to chertsey and i have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour
we remained at weybridge until midday and at that hour we found ourselves at the place near shepperton lock where the wey and thames join part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart the wey has a treble mouth and at this point boats are to be hired and there was a ferry across the river on the shepperton side was an inn with a lawn and beyond that the tower of shepperton church—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees
here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives as yet the flight had not grown to a panic but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross people came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even carrying a small outhouse door between them with some of their household goods piled thereon one man told us he meant to try to get away from shepperton station
there was a lot of shouting and one man was even jesting the idea people seemed to have here was that the martians were simply formidable human beings who might attack and sack the town to be certainly destroyed in the end every now and then people would glance nervously across the wey at the meadows towards chertsey but everything over there was still
across the thames except just where the boats landed everything was quiet in vivid contrast with the surrey side the people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane the big ferryboat had just made a journey three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn staring and jesting at the fugitives without offering to help the inn was closed as it was now within prohibited hours
whats that? cried a boatman and shut up you fool said a man near me to a yelping dog then the sound came again this time from the direction of chertsey a muffled thud—the sound of a gun
the fighting was beginning almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right unseen because of the trees took up the chorus firing heavily one after the other a woman screamed everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle near us and yet invisible to us nothing was to be seen save flat meadows cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight
the sojersll stop em said a woman beside me doubtfully a haziness rose over the treetops
then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air smashing two or three windows in the houses near and leaving us astonished
here they are shouted a man in a blue jersey yonder dyer see them? yonder
quickly one after the other one two three four of the armoured martians appeared far away over the little trees across the flat meadows that stretched towards chertsey and striding hurriedly towards the river little cowled figures they seemed at first going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds
then advancing obliquely towards us came a fifth their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the guns growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer one on the extreme left the remotest that is flourished a huge case high in the air and the ghostly terrible heat-ray i had already seen on friday night smote towards chertsey and struck the town
at sight of these strange swift and terrible creatures the crowd near the waters edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck there was no screaming or shouting but a silence then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feet—a splashing from the water a man too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden a woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me i turned with the rush of the people but i was not too terrified for thought the terrible heat-ray was in my mind to get under water that was it
get under water i shouted unheeded
i faced about again and rushed towards the approaching martian rushed right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water others did the same a boatload of people putting back came leaping out as i rushed past the stones under my feet were muddy and slippery and the river was so low that i ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep then as the martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred yards away i flung myself forward under the surface the splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears people were landing hastily on both sides of the river but the martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked when half suffocated i raised my head above water the martians hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the heat-ray
in another moment it was on the bank and in a stride wading halfway across the knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again close to the village of shepperton forthwith the six guns which unknown to anyone on the right bank had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village fired simultaneously the sudden near concussion the last close upon the first made my heart jump the monster was already raising the case generating the heat-ray as the first shell burst six yards above the hood
i gave a cry of astonishment i saw and thought nothing of the other four martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive but not in time to dodge the fourth shell
the shell burst clean in the face of the thing the hood bulged flashed was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal
hit shouted i with something between a scream and a cheer
i heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me i could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation
the decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not fall over it recovered its balance by a miracle and no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the heat-ray now rigidly upheld it reeled swiftly upon shepperton the living intelligence the martian within the hood was slain and splashed to the four winds of heaven and the thing was now but a mere intricate device of metal whirling to destruction it drove along in a straight line incapable of guidance it struck the tower of shepperton church smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done swerved aside blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into the river out of my sight
a violent explosion shook the air and a spout of water steam mud and shattered metal shot far up into the sky as the camera of the heat-ray hit the water the latter had immediately flashed into steam in another moment a huge wave like a muddy tidal bore but almost scaldingly hot came sweeping round the bend upstream i saw people struggling shorewards and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the martians collapse
for a moment i heeded nothing of the heat forgot the patent need of self-preservation i splashed through the tumultuous water pushing aside a man in black to do so until i could see round the bend half a dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves the fallen martian came into sight downstream lying across the river and for the most part submerged
thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage and through the tumultuously whirling wisps i could see intermittently and vaguely the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray of mud and froth into the air the tentacles swayed and struck like living arms and save for the helpless purposelessness of these movements it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life amid the waves enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine
my attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns a man knee-deep near the towing path shouted inaudibly to me and pointed looking back i saw the other martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of chertsey the shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly
at that i ducked at once under water and holding my breath until movement was an agony blundered painfully ahead under the surface as long as i could the water was in a tumult about me and rapidly growing hotter
when for a moment i raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the martians altogether the noise was deafening then i saw them dimly colossal figures of grey magnified by the mist they had passed by me and two were stooping over the frothing tumultuous ruins of their comrade
the third and fourth stood beside him in the water one perhaps two hundred yards from me the other towards laleham the generators of the heat-rays waved high and the hissing beams smote down this way and that
the air was full of sound a deafening and confusing conflict of noises—the clangorous din of the martians the crash of falling houses the thud of trees fences sheds flashing into flame and the crackling and roaring of fire dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river and as the heat-ray went to and fro over weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames the nearer houses still stood intact awaiting their fate shadowy faint and pallid in the steam with the fire behind them going to and fro
for a moment perhaps i stood there breast-high in the almost boiling water dumbfounded at my position hopeless of escape through the reek i could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds like little frogs hurrying through grass from the advance of a man or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path
then suddenly the white flashes of the heat-ray came leaping towards me the houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar the ray flickered up and down the towing path licking off the people who ran this way and that and came down to the waters edge not fifty yards from where i stood it swept across the river to shepperton and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam i turned shoreward
in another moment the huge wave well-nigh at the boiling-point had rushed upon me i screamed aloud and scalded half blinded agonised i staggered through the leaping hissing water towards the shore had my foot stumbled it would have been the end i fell helplessly in full sight of the martians upon the broad bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the wey and thames i expected nothing but death
i have a dim memory of the foot of a martian coming down within a score of yards of my head driving straight into the loose gravel whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them now clear and then presently faint through a veil of smoke receding interminably as it seemed to me across a vast space of river and meadow and then very slowly i realised that by a miracle i had escaped
xiii how i fell in with the curate
after getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons the martians retreated to their original position upon horsell common; and in their haste and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible victim as myself had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith there was nothing at that time between them and london but batteries of twelve-pounder guns and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden dreadful and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that destroyed lisbon a century ago
but they were in no hurry cylinder followed cylinder on its interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them reinforcement and meanwhile the military and naval authorities now fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists worked with furious energy every minute a fresh gun came into position until before twilight every copse every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about kingston and richmond masked an expectant black muzzle and through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles altogether—that encircled the martian encampment on horsell common through charred and ruined villages among the green trees through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the martian approach but the martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human proximity and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder save at the price of his life
it would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro transferring everything from the second and third cylinders—the second in addlestone golf links and the third at pyrford—to their original pit on horsell common over that above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide stood one as sentinel while the rest abandoned their vast fighting-machines and descended into the pit they were hard at work there far into the night and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about merrow and even it is said from banstead and epsom downs
and while the martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally and in front of me humanity gathered for the battle i made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning weybridge towards london
i saw an abandoned boat very small and remote drifting down-stream; and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes i went after it gained it and so escaped out of that destruction there were no oars in the boat but i contrived to paddle as well as my parboiled hands would allow down the river towards halliford and walton going very tediously and continually looking behind me as you may well understand i followed the river because i considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return
the hot water from the martians overthrow drifted downstream with me so that for the best part of a mile i could see little of either bank once however i made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of weybridge halliford it seemed was deserted and several of the houses facing the river were on fire it was strange to see the place quite tranquil quite desolate under the hot blue sky with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon never before had i seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd a little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay
for a long time i drifted so painful and weary was i after the violence i had been through and so intense the heat upon the water then my fears got the better of me again and i resumed my paddling the sun scorched my bare back at last as the bridge at walton was coming into sight round the bend my fever and faintness overcame my fears and i landed on the middlesex bank and lay down deadly sick amid the long grass i suppose the time was then about four or five oclock i got up presently walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge i seem to remember talking wanderingly to myself during that last spurt i was also very thirsty and bitterly regretful i had drunk no more water it is a curious thing that i felt angry with my wife; i cannot account for it but my impotent desire to reach leatherhead worried me excessively
i do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate so that probably i dozed i became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt sleeves and with his upturned clean-shaven face staring at a faint flickering that danced over the sky the sky was what is called a mackerel sky—rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud just tinted with the midsummer sunset
i sat up and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly
have you any water? i asked abruptly
he shook his head you have been asking for water for the last hour he said
for a moment we were silent taking stock of each other i dare say he found me a strange enough figure naked save for my water-soaked trousers and socks scalded and my face and shoulders blackened by the smoke his face was a fair weakness his chin retreated and his hair lay in crisp almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were rather large pale blue and blankly staring he spoke abruptly looking vacantly away from me
what does it mean? he said what do these things mean?
i stared at him and made no answer
he extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone
why are these things permitted? what sins have we done? the morning service was over i was walking through the roads to clear my brain for the afternoon and then—fire earthquake death as if it were sodom and gomorrah all our work undone all the work—— what are these martians?
what are we? i answered clearing my throat
he gripped his knees and turned to look at me again for half a minute perhaps he stared silently
i was walking through the roads to clear my brain he said and suddenly—fire earthquake death
he relapsed into silence with his chin now sunken almost to his knees
presently he began waving his hand
all the work—all the sunday schools—what have we done—what has weybridge done? everything gone—everything destroyed the church we rebuilt it only three years ago gone swept out of existence why?
another pause and he broke out again like one demented
the smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever he shouted
his eyes flamed and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of weybridge
by this time i was beginning to take his measure the tremendous tragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive from weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason
are we far from sunbury? i said in a matter-of-fact tone
what are we to do? he asked are these creatures everywhere? has the earth been given over to them?
are we far from sunbury? only this morning i officiated at early celebration——
things have changed i said quietly you must keep your head there is still hope
hope yes plentiful hope—for all this destruction
i began to explain my view of our position he listened at first but as i went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their former stare and his regard wandered from me
this must be the beginning of the end he said interrupting me the end the great and terrible day of the lord when men shall call upon the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne
i began to understand the position i ceased my laboured reasoning struggled to my feet and standing over him laid my hand on his shoulder
be a man said i you are scared out of your wits what good is religion if it collapses under calamity? think of what earthquakes and floods wars and volcanoes have done before to men did you think god had exempted weybridge? he is not an insurance agent
for a time he sat in blank silence
but how can we escape? he asked suddenly they are invulnerable they are pitiless
neither the one nor perhaps the other i answered and the mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be one of them was killed yonder not three hours ago
killed he said staring about him how can gods ministers be killed?
i saw it happen i proceeded to tell him we have chanced to come in for the thick of it said i and that is all
what is that flicker in the sky? he asked abruptly
i told him it was the heliograph signalling—that it was the sign of human help and effort in the sky
we are in the midst of it i said quiet as it is that flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm yonder i take it are the martians and londonward where those hills rise about richmond and kingston and the trees give cover earthworks are being thrown up and guns are being placed presently the martians will be coming this way again
and even as i spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture
listen he said from beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of distant guns and a remote weird crying then everything was still a cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us high in the west the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of weybridge and shepperton and the hot still splendour of the sunset
we had better follow this path i said northward
xiv in london my younger brother was in london when the martians fell at woking he was a medical student working for an imminent examination and he heard nothing of the arrival until saturday morning the morning papers on saturday contained in addition to lengthy special articles on the planet mars on life in the planets and so forth a brief and vaguely worded telegram all the more striking for its brevity
the martians alarmed by the approach of a crowd had killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun so the story ran the telegram concluded with the words: formidable as they seem to be the martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen and indeed seem incapable of doing so probably this is due to the relative strength of the earths gravitational energy on that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly
of course all the students in the crammers biology class to which my brother went that day were intensely interested but there were no signs of any unusual excitement in the streets the afternoon papers puffed scraps of news under big headlines they had nothing to tell beyond the movements of troops about the common and the burning of the pine woods between woking and weybridge until eight then the _st jamess gazette_ in an extra-special edition announced the bare fact of the interruption of telegraphic communication this was thought to be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line nothing more of the fighting was known that night the night of my drive to leatherhead and back
my brother felt no anxiety about us as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house he made up his mind to run down that night to me in order as he says to see the things before they were killed he dispatched a telegram which never reached me about four oclock and spent the evening at a music hall
in london also on saturday night there was a thunderstorm and my brother reached waterloo in a cab on the platform from which the midnight train usually starts he learned after some waiting that an accident prevented trains from reaching woking that night the nature of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time there was very little excitement in the station as the officials failing to realise that anything further than a breakdown between byfleet and woking junction had occurred were running the theatre trains which usually passed through woking round by virginia water or guildford they were busy making the necessary arrangements to alter the route of the southampton and portsmouth sunday league excursions a nocturnal newspaper reporter mistaking my brother for the traffic manager to whom he bears a slight resemblance waylaid and tried to interview him few people excepting the railway officials connected the breakdown with the martians
i have read in another account of these events that on sunday morning all london was electrified by the news from woking as a matter of fact there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase plenty of londoners did not hear of the martians until the panic of monday morning those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily worded telegrams in the sunday papers conveyed the majority of people in london do not read sunday papers
the habit of personal security moreover is so deeply fixed in the londoners mind and startling intelligence so much a matter of course in the papers that they could read without any personal tremors: about seven oclock last night the martians came out of the cylinder and moving about under an armour of metallic shields have completely wrecked woking station with the adjacent houses and massacred an entire battalion of the cardigan regiment no details are known maxims have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have been disabled by them flying hussars have been galloping into chertsey the martians appear to be moving slowly towards chertsey or windsor great anxiety prevails in west surrey and earthworks are being thrown up to check the advance londonward that was how the _sunday sun_ put it and a clever and remarkably prompt handbook article in the _referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly let loose in a village
no one in london knew positively of the nature of the armoured martians and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be sluggish: crawling creeping painfully—such expressions occurred in almost all the earlier reports none of the telegrams could have been written by an eyewitness of their advance the sunday papers printed separate editions as further news came to hand some even in default of it but there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in the afternoon when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in their possession it was stated that the people of walton and weybridge and all the district were pouring along the roads londonward and that was all
my brother went to church at the foundling hospital in the morning still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night there he heard allusions made to the invasion and a special prayer for peace coming out he bought a _referee_ he became alarmed at the news in this and went again to waterloo station to find out if communication were restored the omnibuses carriages cyclists and innumerable people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the strange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating people were interested or if alarmed alarmed only on account of the local residents at the station he heard for the first time that the windsor and chertsey lines were now interrupted the porters told him that several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from byfleet and chertsey stations but that these had abruptly ceased my brother could get very little precise detail out of them
theres fighting going on about weybridge was the extent of their information
the train service was now very much disorganised quite a number of people who had been expecting friends from places on the south-western network were standing about the station one grey-headed old gentleman came and abused the south-western company bitterly to my brother it wants showing up he said
one or two trains came in from richmond putney and kingston containing people who had gone out for a days boating and found the locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air a man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother full of strange tidings
theres hosts of people driving into kingston in traps and carts and things with boxes of valuables and all that he said they come from molesey and weybridge and walton and they say theres been guns heard at chertsey heavy firing and that mounted soldiers have told them to get off at once because the martians are coming we heard guns firing at hampton court station but we thought it was thunder what the dickens does it all mean? the martians cant get out of their pit can they?
my brother could not tell him
afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the clients of the underground railway and that the sunday excursionists began to return from all over the south-western lung—barnes wimbledon richmond park kew and so forth—at unnaturally early hours; but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered
about five oclock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely excited by the opening of the line of communication which is almost invariably closed between the south-eastern and the south-western stations and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and carriages crammed with soldiers these were the guns that were brought up from woolwich and chatham to cover kingston there was an exchange of pleasantries: youll get eaten were the beast-tamers and so forth a little while after that a squad of police came into the station and began to clear the public off the platforms and my brother went out into the street again
the church bells were ringing for evensong and a squad of salvation army lassies came singing down waterloo road on the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches the sun was just setting and the clock tower and the houses of parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it is possible to imagine a sky of gold barred with long transverse stripes of reddish-purple cloud there was talk of a floating body one of the men there a reservist he said he was told my brother he had seen the heliograph flickering in the west
in wellington street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had just been rushed out of fleet street with still-wet newspapers and staring placards dreadful catastrophe they bawled one to the other down wellington street fighting at weybridge full description repulse of the martians london in danger he had to give threepence for a copy of that paper
then it was and then only that he realised something of the full power and terror of these monsters he learned that they were not merely a handful of small sluggish creatures but that they were minds swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand against them
they were described as vast spiderlike machines nearly a hundred feet high capable of the speed of an express train and able to shoot out a beam of intense heat masked batteries chiefly of field guns had been planted in the country about horsell common and especially between the woking district and london five of the machines had been seen moving towards the thames and one by a happy chance had been destroyed in the other cases the shells had missed and the batteries had been at once annihilated by the heat-rays heavy losses of soldiers were mentioned but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic
the martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable they had retreated to their triangle of cylinders again in the circle about woking signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from all sides guns were in rapid transit from windsor portsmouth aldershot woolwich—even from the north; among others long wire-guns of ninety-five tons from woolwich altogether one hundred and sixteen were in position or being hastily placed chiefly covering london never before in england had there been such a vast or rapid concentration of military material
any further cylinders that fell it was hoped could be destroyed at once by high explosives which were being rapidly manufactured and distributed no doubt ran the report the situation was of the strangest and gravest description but the public was exhorted to avoid and discourage panic no doubt the martians were strange and terrible in the extreme but at the outside there could not be more than twenty of them against our millions
the authorities had reason to suppose from the size of the cylinders that at the outside there could not be more than five in each cylinder—fifteen altogether and one at least was disposed of—perhaps more the public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger and elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in the threatened southwestern suburbs and so with reiterated assurances of the safety of london and the ability of the authorities to cope with the difficulty this quasi-proclamation closed
this was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still wet and there had been no time to add a word of comment it was curious my brother said to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place
all down wellington street people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading and the strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers men came scrambling off buses to secure copies certainly this news excited people intensely whatever their previous apathy the shutters of a map shop in the strand were being taken down my brother said and a man in his sunday raiment lemon-yellow gloves even was visible inside the window hastily fastening maps of surrey to the glass
going on along the strand to trafalgar square the paper in his hand my brother saw some of the fugitives from west surrey there was a man with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart such as greengrocers use he was driving from the direction of westminster bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or six respectable-looking people in it and some boxes and bundles the faces of these people were haggard and their entire appearance contrasted conspicuously with the sabbath-best appearance of the people on the omnibuses people in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of cabs they stopped at the square as if undecided which way to take and finally turned eastward along the strand some way behind these came a man in workday clothes riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles with a small front wheel he was dirty and white in the face
my brother turned down towards victoria and met a number of such people he had a vague idea that he might see something of me he noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic some of the refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses one was professing to have seen the martians boilers on stilts i tell you striding along like men most of them were excited and animated by their strange experience
beyond victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these arrivals at all the street corners groups of people were reading papers talking excitedly or staring at these unusual sunday visitors they seemed to increase as night drew on until at last the roads my brother said were like epsom high street on a derby day my brother addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers from most
none of them could tell him any news of woking except one man who assured him that woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous night
i come from byfleet he said; a man on a bicycle came through the place in the early morning and ran from door to door warning us to come away then came soldiers we went out to look and there were clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke and not a soul coming that way then we heard the guns at chertsey and folks coming from weybridge so ive locked up my house and come on
at that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the invaders without all this inconvenience
about eight oclock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all over the south of london my brother could not hear it for the traffic in the main thoroughfares but by striking through the quiet back streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly
he walked from westminster to his apartments near regents park about two he was now very anxious on my account and disturbed at the evident magnitude of the trouble his mind was inclined to run even as mine had run on saturday on military details he thought of all those silent expectant guns of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried to imagine boilers on stilts a hundred feet high
there were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along oxford street and several in the marylebone road but so slowly was the news spreading that regent street and portland place were full of their usual sunday-night promenaders albeit they talked in groups and along the edge of regents park there were as many silent couples walking out together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been the night was warm and still and a little oppressive; the sound of guns continued intermittently and after midnight there seemed to be sheet lightning in the south
he read and re-read the paper fearing the worst had happened to me he was restless and after supper prowled out again aimlessly he returned and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes he went to bed a little after midnight and was awakened from lurid dreams in the small hours of monday by the sound of door knockers feet running in the street distant drumming and a clamour of bells red reflections danced on the ceiling for a moment he lay astonished wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad then he jumped out of bed and ran to the window
his room was an attic and as he thrust his head out up and down the street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash and heads in every kind of night disarray appeared enquiries were being shouted they are coming bawled a policeman hammering at the door; the martians are coming and hurried to the next door
the sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the albany street barracks and every church within earshot was hard at work killing sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin there was a noise of doors opening and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination
up the street came galloping a closed carriage bursting abruptly into noise at the corner rising to a clattering climax under the window and dying away slowly in the distance close on the rear of this came a couple of cabs the forerunners of a long procession of flying vehicles going for the most part to chalk farm station where the north-western special trains were loading up instead of coming down the gradient into euston
for a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank astonishment watching the policemen hammering at door after door and delivering their incomprehensible message then the door behind him opened and the man who lodged across the landing came in dressed only in shirt trousers and slippers his braces loose about his waist his hair disordered from his pillow
what the devil is it? he asked a fire? what a devil of a row
they both craned their heads out of the window straining to hear what the policemen were shouting people were coming out of the side streets and standing in groups at the corners talking
what the devil is it all about? said my brothers fellow lodger
my brother answered him vaguely and began to dress running with each garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing excitement and presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came bawling into the street:
london in danger of suffocation the kingston and richmond defences forced fearful massacres in the thames valley
and all about him—in the rooms below in the houses on each side and across the road and behind in the park terraces and in the hundred other streets of that part of marylebone and the westbourne park district and st pancras and westward and northward in kilburn and st johns wood and hampstead and eastward in shoreditch and highbury and haggerston and hoxton and indeed through all the vastness of london from ealing to east ham—people were rubbing their eyes and opening windows to stare out and ask aimless questions dressing hastily as the first breath of the coming storm of fear blew through the streets it was the dawn of the great panic london which had gone to bed on sunday night oblivious and inert was awakened in the small hours of monday morning to a vivid sense of danger
unable from his window to learn what was happening my brother went down and out into the street just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early dawn the flying people on foot and in vehicles grew more numerous every moment black smoke he heard people crying and again black smoke the contagion of such a unanimous fear was inevitable as my brother hesitated on the door-step he saw another newsvendor approaching and got a paper forthwith the man was running away with the rest and selling his papers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and panic
and from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the commander-in-chief:
the martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means of rockets they have smothered our batteries destroyed richmond kingston and wimbledon and are advancing slowly towards london destroying everything on the way it is impossible to stop them there is no safety from the black smoke but in instant flight
that was all but it was enough the whole population of the great six-million city was stirring slipping running; presently it would be pouring _en masse_ northward
black smoke the voices cried fire
the bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult a cart carelessly driven smashed amid shrieks and curses against the water trough up the street sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps and overhead the dawn was growing brighter clear and steady and calm
he heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms and up and down stairs behind him his landlady came to the door loosely wrapped in dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed ejaculating
as my brother began to realise the import of all these things he turned hastily to his own room put all his available money—some ten pounds altogether—into his pockets and went out again into the streets
xv what had happened in surrey
it was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the hedge in the flat meadows near halliford and while my brother was watching the fugitives stream over westminster bridge that the martians had resumed the offensive so far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the horsell pit until nine that night hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke
but three certainly came out about eight oclock and advancing slowly and cautiously made their way through byfleet and pyrford towards ripley and weybridge and so came in sight of the expectant batteries against the setting sun these martians did not advance in a body but in a line each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow they communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls running up and down the scale from one note to another
it was this howling and firing of the guns at ripley and st georges hill that we had heard at upper halliford the ripley gunners unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in such a position fired one wild premature ineffectual volley and bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village while the martian without using his heat-ray walked serenely over their guns stepped gingerly among them passed in front of them and so came unexpectedly upon the guns in painshill park which he destroyed
the st georges hill men however were better led or of a better mettle hidden by a pine wood as they were they seem to have been quite unsuspected by the martian nearest to them they laid their guns as deliberately as if they had been on parade and fired at about a thousand yards range
the shells flashed all round him and he was seen to advance a few paces stagger and go down everybody yelled together and the guns were reloaded in frantic haste the overthrown martian set up a prolonged ululation and immediately a second glittering giant answering him appeared over the trees to the south it would seem that a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells the whole of the second volley flew wide of the martian on the ground and simultaneously both his companions brought their heat-rays to bear on the battery the ammunition blew up the pine trees all about the guns flashed into fire and only one or two of the men who were already running over the crest of the hill escaped
after this it would seem that the three took counsel together and halted and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained absolutely stationary for the next half hour the martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood a small brown figure oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight and apparently engaged in the repair of his support about nine he had finished for his cowl was then seen above the trees again
it was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other martians each carrying a thick black tube a similar tube was handed to each of the three and the seven proceeded to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between st georges hill weybridge and the village of send southwest of ripley
a dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they began to move and warned the waiting batteries about ditton and esher at the same time four of their fighting machines similarly armed with tubes crossed the river and two of them black against the western sky came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of halliford they moved as it seemed to us upon a cloud for a milky mist covered the fields and rose to a third of their height
at this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat and began running; but i knew it was no good running from a martian and i turned aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad ditch by the side of the road he looked back saw what i was doing and turned to join me
the two halted the nearer to us standing and facing sunbury the remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star away towards staines
the occasional howling of the martians had ceased; they took up their positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute silence it was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns never since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still to us and to an observer about ripley it would have had precisely the same effect—the martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling night lit only as it was by the slender moon the stars the afterglow of the daylight and the ruddy glare from st georges hill and the woods of painshill
but facing that crescent everywhere—at staines hounslow ditton esher ockham behind hills and woods south of the river and across the flat grass meadows to the north of it wherever a cluster of trees or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting the signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and vanished and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a tense expectation the martians had but to advance into the line of fire and instantly those motionless black forms of men those guns glittering so darkly in the early night would explode into a thunderous fury of battle
no doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant minds even as it was uppermost in mine was the riddle—how much they understood of us did they grasp that we in our millions were organized disciplined working together? or did they interpret our spurts of fire the sudden stinging of our shells our steady investment of their encampment as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? did they dream they might exterminate us? (at that time no one knew what food they needed) a hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as i watched that vast sentinel shape and in the back of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces londonward had they prepared pitfalls? were the powder mills at hounslow ready as a snare? would the londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater moscow of their mighty province of houses?
then after an interminable time as it seemed to us crouching and peering through the hedge came a sound like the distant concussion of a gun another nearer and then another and then the martian beside us raised his tube on high and discharged it gunwise with a heavy report that made the ground heave the one towards staines answered him there was no flash no smoke simply that loaded detonation
i was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that i so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber up into the hedge and stare towards sunbury as i did so a second report followed and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards hounslow i expected at least to see smoke or fire or some such evidence of its work but all i saw was the deep blue sky above with one solitary star and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath and there had been no crash no answering explosion the silence was restored; the minute lengthened to three
what has happened? said the curate standing up beside me
heaven knows said i a bat flickered by and vanished a distant tumult of shouting began and ceased i looked again at the martian and saw he was now moving eastward along the riverbank with a swift rolling motion
every moment i expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon him; but the evening calm was unbroken the figure of the martian grew smaller as he receded and presently the mist and the gathering night had swallowed him up by a common impulse we clambered higher towards sunbury was a dark appearance as though a conical hill had suddenly come into being there hiding our view of the farther country; and then remoter across the river over walton we saw another such summit these hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared
moved by a sudden thought i looked northward and there i perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen
everything had suddenly become very still far away to the southeast marking the quiet we heard the martians hooting to one another and then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns but the earthly artillery made no reply
now at the time we could not understand these things but later i was to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the twilight each of the martians standing in the great crescent i have described had discharged by means of the gunlike tube he carried a huge canister over whatever hill copse cluster of houses or other possible cover for guns chanced to be in front of him some fired only one of these some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one at ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time these canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy inky vapour coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country and the touch of that vapour the inhaling of its pungent wisps was death to all that breathes
it was heavy this vapour heavier than the densest smoke so that after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact it sank down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather liquid than gaseous abandoning the hills and streaming into the valleys and ditches and watercourses even as i have heard the carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do and where it came upon water some chemical action occurred and the surface would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and made way for more the scum was absolutely insoluble and it is a strange thing seeing the instant effect of the gas that one could drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained the vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do it hung together in banks flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving reluctantly before the wind and very slowly it combined with the mist and moisture of the air and sank to the earth in the form of dust save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance
once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over the black smoke clung so closely to the ground even before its precipitation that fifty feet up in the air on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether as was proved even that night at street cobham and ditton
the man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its coiling flow and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its inky nothingness for a day and a half he remained there weary starving and sun-scorched the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse with red roofs green trees and later black-veiled shrubs and gates barns outhouses and walls rising here and there into the sunlight
but that was at street cobham where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground as a rule the martians when it had served its purpose cleared the air of it again by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it
this they did with the vapour banks near us as we saw in the starlight from the window of a deserted house at upper halliford whither we had returned from there we could see the searchlights on richmond hill and kingston hill going to and fro and about eleven the windows rattled and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in position there these continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour sending chance shots at the invisible martians at hampton and ditton and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished and were replaced by a bright red glow
then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as i learned afterwards in bushey park before the guns on the richmond and kingston line of hills began there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest due i believe to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners
so setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps nest the martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the londonward country the horns of the crescent slowly moved apart until at last they formed a line from hanwell to coombe and malden all night through their destructive tubes advanced never once after the martian at st georges hill was brought down did they give the artillery the ghost of a chance against them wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged and where the guns were openly displayed the heat-ray was brought to bear
by midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of richmond park and the glare of kingston hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke blotting out the whole valley of the thames and extending as far as the eye could reach and through this two martians slowly waded and turned their hissing steam jets this way and that
they were sparing of the heat-ray that night either because they had but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the opposition they had aroused in the latter aim they certainly succeeded sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to their movements after that no body of men would stand against them so hopeless was the enterprise even the crews of the torpedo-boats and destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the thames refused to stop mutinied and went down again the only offensive operation men ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and pitfalls and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic
one has to imagine as well as one may the fate of those batteries towards esher waiting so tensely in the twilight survivors there were none one may picture the orderly expectation the officers alert and watchful the gunners ready the ammunition piled to hand the limber gunners with their horses and waggons the groups of civilian spectators standing as near as they were permitted the evening stillness the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and wounded from weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the martians fired and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields
one may picture too the sudden shifting of the attention the swiftly spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong towering heavenward turning the twilight to a palpable darkness a strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims men and horses near it seen dimly running shrieking falling headlong shouts of dismay the guns suddenly abandoned men choking and writhing on the ground and the swift broadening-out of the opaque cone of smoke and then night and extinction—nothing but a silent mass of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead
before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of richmond and the disintegrating organism of government was with a last expiring effort rousing the population of london to the necessity of flight
xvi the exodus from london so you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the greatest city in the world just as monday was dawning—the stream of flight rising swiftly to a torrent lashing in a foaming tumult round the railway stations banked up into a horrible struggle about the shipping in the thames and hurrying by every available channel northward and eastward by ten oclock the police organisation and by midday even the railway organisations were losing coherency losing shape and efficiency guttering softening running at last in that swift liquefaction of the social body
all the railway lines north of the thames and the south-eastern people at cannon street had been warned by midnight on sunday and trains were being filled people were fighting savagely for standing-room in the carriages even at two oclock by three people were being trampled and crushed even in bishopsgate street a couple of hundred yards or more from liverpool street station; revolvers were fired people stabbed and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic exhausted and infuriated were breaking the heads of the people they were called out to protect
and as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to return to london the pressure of the flight drove the people in an ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the northward-running roads by midday a martian had been seen at barnes and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the thames and across the flats of lambeth cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance another bank drove over ealing and surrounded a little island of survivors on castle hill alive but unable to escape
after a fruitless struggle to get aboard a north-western train at chalk farm—the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there _ploughed_ through shrieking people and a dozen stalwart men fought to keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace—my brother emerged upon the chalk farm road dodged across through a hurrying swarm of vehicles and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a cycle shop the front tire of the machine he got was punctured in dragging it through the window but he got up and off notwithstanding with no further injury than a cut wrist the steep foot of haverstock hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses and my brother struck into belsize road
so he got out of the fury of the panic and skirting the edgware road reached edgware about seven fasting and wearied but well ahead of the crowd along the road people were standing in the roadway curious wondering he was passed by a number of cyclists some horsemen and two motor cars a mile from edgware the rim of the wheel broke and the machine became unridable he left it by the roadside and trudged through the village there were shops half opened in the main street of the place and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and windows staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of fugitives that was beginning he succeeded in getting some food at an inn
for a time he remained in edgware not knowing what next to do the flying people increased in number many of them like my brother seemed inclined to loiter in the place there was no fresh news of the invaders from mars
at that time the road was crowded but as yet far from congested most of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles but there were soon motor cars hansom cabs and carriages hurrying along and the dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to st albans
it was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to chelmsford where some friends of his lived that at last induced my brother to strike into a quiet lane running eastward presently he came upon a stile and crossing it followed a footpath northeastward he passed near several farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn he saw few fugitives until in a grass lane towards high barnet he happened upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers he came upon them just in time to save them
he heard their screams and hurrying round the corner saw a couple of men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they had been driving while a third with difficulty held the frightened ponys head one of the ladies a short woman dressed in white was simply screaming; the other a dark slender figure slashed at the man who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand
my brother immediately grasped the situation shouted and hurried towards the struggle one of the men desisted and turned towards him and my brother realising from his antagonists face that a fight was unavoidable and being an expert boxer went into him forthwith and sent him down against the wheel of the chaise
it was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the slender ladys arm he heard the clatter of hoofs the whip stung across his face a third antagonist struck him between the eyes and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come
partly stunned he found himself facing the man who had held the horses head and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the lane swaying from side to side and with the women in it looking back the man before him a burly rough tried to close and he stopped him with a blow in the face then realising that he was deserted he dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise with the sturdy man close behind him and the fugitive who had turned now following remotely
suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong and he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again he would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help it seems she had had a revolver all this time but it had been under the seat when she and her companion were attacked she fired at six yards distance narrowly missing my brother the less courageous of the robbers made off and his companion followed him cursing his cowardice they both stopped in sight down the lane where the third man lay insensible
take this said the slender lady and she gave my brother her revolver
go back to the chaise said my brother wiping the blood from his split lip
she turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony
the robbers had evidently had enough of it when my brother looked again they were retreating
ill sit here said my brother if i may; and he got upon the empty front seat the lady looked over her shoulder
give me the reins she said and laid the whip along the ponys side in another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my brothers eyes
so quite unexpectedly my brother found himself panting with a cut mouth a bruised jaw and bloodstained knuckles driving along an unknown lane with these two women
he learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon living at stanmore who had come in the small hours from a dangerous case at pinner and heard at some railway station on his way of the martian advance he had hurried home roused the women—their servant had left them two days before—packed some provisions put his revolver under the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to edgware with the idea of getting a train there he stopped behind to tell the neighbours he would overtake them he said at about half past four in the morning and now it was nearly nine and they had seen nothing of him they could not stop in edgware because of the growing traffic through the place and so they had come into this side lane
that was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently they stopped again nearer to new barnet he promised to stay with them at least until they could determine what to do or until the missing man arrived and professed to be an expert shot with the revolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence
they made a sort of encampment by the wayside and the pony became happy in the hedge he told them of his own escape out of london and all that he knew of these martians and their ways the sun crept higher in the sky and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an uneasy state of anticipation several wayfarers came along the lane and of these my brother gathered such news as he could every broken answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had come on humanity deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity for prosecuting this flight he urged the matter upon them
we have money said the slender woman and hesitated
her eyes met my brothers and her hesitation ended
so have i said my brother
she explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold besides a five-pound note and suggested that with that they might get upon a train at st albans or new barnet my brother thought that was hopeless seeing the fury of the londoners to crowd upon the trains and broached his own idea of striking across essex towards harwich and thence escaping from the country altogether
mrs elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen to no reasoning and kept calling upon george; but her sister-in-law was astonishingly quiet and deliberate and at last agreed to my brothers suggestion so designing to cross the great north road they went on towards barnet my brother leading the pony to save it as much as possible as the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively hot and under foot a thick whitish sand grew burning and blinding so that they travelled only very slowly the hedges were grey with dust and as they advanced towards barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew stronger
they began to meet more people for the most part these were staring before them murmuring indistinct questions jaded haggard unclean one man in evening dress passed them on foot his eyes on the ground they heard his voice and looking back at him saw one hand clutched in his hair and the other beating invisible things his paroxysm of rage over he went on his way without once looking back
as my brothers party went on towards the crossroads to the south of barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on their left carrying a child and with two other children; and then passed a man in dirty black with a thick stick in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other then round the corner of the lane from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high road came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat grey with dust there were three girls east end factory girls and a couple of little children crowded in the cart
thisll tike us rahnd edgware? asked the driver wild-eyed white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the left he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks
my brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in front of them and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas mrs elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot blue sky the tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of many voices the gride of many wheels the creaking of waggons and the staccato of hoofs the lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the crossroads
good heavens cried mrs elphinstone what is this you are driving us into?
my brother stopped for the main road was a boiling stream of people a torrent of human beings rushing northward one pressing on another a great bank of dust white and luminous in the blaze of the sun made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot and by the wheels of vehicles of every description
way my brother heard voices crying make way
it was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire and the dust was hot and pungent and indeed a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion
two men came past them then a dirty woman carrying a heavy bundle and weeping a lost retriever dog with hanging tongue circled dubiously round them scared and wretched and fled at my brothers threat
so much as they could see of the road londonward between the houses to the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty hurrying people pent in between the villas on either side; the black heads the crowded forms grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner hurried past and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust
go on go on cried the voices way way
one mans hands pressed on the back of another my brother stood at the ponys head irresistibly attracted he advanced slowly pace by pace down the lane
edgware had been a scene of confusion chalk farm a riotous tumult but this was a whole population in movement it is hard to imagine that host it had no character of its own the figures poured out past the corner and receded with their backs to the group in the lane along the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels stumbling in the ditches blundering into one another
the carts and carriages crowded close upon one another making little way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the villas
push on was the cry push on they are coming
in one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the salvation army gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling eternity eternity his voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust some of the people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless staring at nothing with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst or lay prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances the horses bits were covered with foam their eyes bloodshot
there were cabs carriages shop-carts waggons beyond counting; a mail cart a road-cleaners cart marked vestry of st pancras a huge timber waggon crowded with roughs a brewers dray rumbled by with its two near wheels splashed with fresh blood
clear the way cried the voices clear the way
eter-nity eter-nity came echoing down the road
there were sad haggard women tramping by well dressed with children that cried and stumbled their dainty clothes smothered in dust their weary faces smeared with tears with many of these came men sometimes helpful sometimes lowering and savage fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags wide-eyed loud-voiced and foul-mouthed there were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along wretched unkempt men clothed like clerks or shopmen struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed men dressed in the clothes of railway porters one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it
but varied as its composition was certain things all that host had in common there were fear and pain on their faces and fear behind them a tumult up the road a quarrel for a place in a waggon sent the whole host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed activity the heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude their skins were dry their lips black and cracked they were all thirsty weary and footsore and amid the various cries one heard disputes reproaches groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak through it all ran a refrain:
way way the martians are coming
few stopped and came aside from that flood the lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of london yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again a little way down the lane with two friends bending over him lay a man with a bare leg wrapped about with bloody rags he was a lucky man to have friends
a little old man with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat limped out and sat down beside the trap removed his boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble and hobbled on again; and then a little girl of eight or nine all alone threw herself under the hedge close by my brother weeping
i cant go on i cant go on
my brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up speaking gently to her and carried her to miss elphinstone so soon as my brother touched her she became quite still as if frightened
ellen shrieked a woman in the crowd with tears in her voice—ellen and the child suddenly darted away from my brother crying mother
they are coming said a man on horseback riding past along the lane
out of the way there bawled a coachman towering high; and my brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane
the people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse my brother pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge and the man drove by and stopped at the turn of the way it was a carriage with a pole for a pair of horses but only one was in the traces my brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge
one of the men came running to my brother
where is there any water? he said he is dying fast and very thirsty it is lord garrick
lord garrick said my brother; the chief justice?
the water? he said there may be a tap said my brother in some of the houses we have no water i dare not leave my people
the man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house
go on said the people thrusting at him they are coming go on
then my brothers attention was distracted by a bearded eagle-faced man lugging a small handbag which split even as my brothers eyes rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up into separate coins as it struck the ground they rolled hither and thither among the struggling feet of men and horses the man stopped and looked stupidly at the heap and the shaft of a cab struck his shoulder and sent him reeling he gave a shriek and dodged back and a cartwheel shaved him narrowly
way cried the men all about him make way
so soon as the cab had passed he flung himself with both hands open upon the heap of coins and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket a horse rose close upon him and in another moment half rising he had been borne down under the horses hoofs
stop screamed my brother and pushing a woman out of his way tried to clutch the bit of the horse
before he could get to it he heard a scream under the wheels and saw through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretchs back the driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother who ran round behind the cart the multitudinous shouting confused his ears the man was writhing in the dust among his scattered money unable to rise for the wheel had broken his back and his lower limbs lay limp and dead my brother stood up and yelled at the next driver and a man on a black horse came to his assistance
get him out of the road said he; and clutching the mans collar with his free hand my brother lugged him sideways but he still clutched after his money and regarded my brother fiercely hammering at his arm with a handful of gold go on go on shouted angry voices behind way way
there was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that the man on horseback stopped my brother looked up and the man with the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar there was a concussion and the black horse came staggering sideways and the carthorse pushed beside it a hoof missed my brothers foot by a hairs breadth he released his grip on the fallen man and jumped back he saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on the ground and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne backward and carried past the entrance of the lane and had to fight hard in the torrent to recover it
he saw miss elphinstone covering her eyes and a little child with all a childs want of sympathetic imagination staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still ground and crushed under the rolling wheels let us go back he shouted and began turning the pony round we cannot cross this—hell he said and they went back a hundred yards the way they had come until the fighting crowd was hidden as they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet deadly white and drawn and shining with perspiration the two women sat silent crouching in their seat and shivering
then beyond the bend my brother stopped again miss elphinstone was white and pale and her sister-in-law sat weeping too wretched even to call upon george my brother was horrified and perplexed so soon as they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to attempt this crossing he turned to miss elphinstone suddenly resolute
we must go that way he said and led the pony round again
for the second time that day this girl proved her quality to force their way into the torrent of people my brother plunged into the traffic and held back a cab horse while she drove the pony across its head a waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter from the chaise in another moment they were caught and swept forward by the stream my brother with the cabmans whip marks red across his face and hands scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her
point the revolver at the man behind he said giving it to her if he presses us too hard no—point it at his horse
then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across the road but once in the stream he seemed to lose volition to become a part of that dusty rout they swept through chipping barnet with the torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before they had fought across to the opposite side of the way it was din and confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks repeatedly and this to some extent relieved the stress
they struck eastward through hadley and there on either side of the road and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude of people drinking at the stream some fighting to come at the water and farther on from a lull near east barnet they saw two trains running slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains swarming with people with men even among the coals behind the engines—going northward along the great northern railway my brother supposes they must have filled outside london for at that time the furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini impossible
near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon for the violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them they began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold and none of them dared to sleep and in the evening many people came hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place fleeing from unknown dangers before them and going in the direction from which my brother had come
xvii the thunder child had the martians aimed only at destruction they might on monday have annihilated the entire population of london as it spread itself slowly through the home counties not only along the road through barnet but also through edgware and waltham abbey and along the roads eastward to southend and shoeburyness and south of the thames to deal and broadstairs poured the same frantic rout if one could have hung that june morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above london every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress i have set forth at length in the last chapter my brothers account of the road through chipping barnet in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned never before in the history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together the legendary hosts of goths and huns the hugest armies asia has ever seen would have been but a drop in that current and this was no disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and terrible—without order and without a goal six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong it was the beginning of the rout of civilisation of the massacre of mankind
directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of streets far and wide houses churches squares crescents gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map and in the southward _blotted_ over ealing richmond wimbledon it would have seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart steadily incessantly each black splash grew and spread shooting out ramifications this way and that now banking itself against rising ground now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper
and beyond over the blue hills that rise southward of the river the glittering martians went to and fro calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose and taking possession of the conquered country they do not seem to have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and the destruction of any opposition they exploded any stores of powder they came upon cut every telegraph and wrecked the railways here and there they were hamstringing mankind they seemed in no hurry to extend the field of their operations and did not come beyond the central part of london all that day it is possible that a very considerable number of people in london stuck to their houses through monday morning certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the black smoke
until about midday the pool of london was an astonishing scene steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there tempted by the enormous sums of money offered by fugitives and it is said that many who swam out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned about one oclock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of blackfriars bridge at that the pool became a scene of mad confusion fighting and collision and for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern arch of the tower bridge and the sailors and lightermen had to fight savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront people were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from above
when an hour later a martian appeared beyond the clock tower and waded down the river nothing but wreckage floated above limehouse
of the falling of the fifth cylinder i have presently to tell the sixth star fell at wimbledon my brother keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills on tuesday the little party still set upon getting across the sea made its way through the swarming country towards colchester the news that the martians were now in possession of the whole of london was confirmed they had been seen at highgate and even it was said at neasden but they did not come into my brothers view until the morrow
that day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of provisions as they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be regarded farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds granaries and ripening root crops with arms in their hands a number of people now like my brother had their faces eastward and there were some desperate souls even going back towards london to get food these were chiefly people from the northern suburbs whose knowledge of the black smoke came by hearsay he heard that about half the members of the government had gathered at birmingham and that enormous quantities of high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines across the midland counties
he was also told that the midland railway company had replaced the desertions of the first days panic had resumed traffic and was running northward trains from st albans to relieve the congestion of the home counties there was also a placard in chipping ongar announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed among the starving people in the neighbourhood but this intelligence did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed and the three pressed eastward all day and heard no more of the bread distribution than this promise nor as a matter of fact did anyone else hear more of it that night fell the seventh star falling upon primrose hill it fell while miss elphinstone was watching for she took that duty alternately with my brother she saw it
on wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field of unripe wheat—reached chelmsford and there a body of the inhabitants calling itself the committee of public supply seized the pony as provisions and would give nothing in exchange for it but the promise of a share in it the next day here there were rumours of martians at epping and news of the destruction of waltham abbey powder mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders
people were watching for martians here from the church towers my brother very luckily for him as it chanced preferred to push on at once to the coast rather than wait for food although all three of them were very hungry by midday they passed through tillingham which strangely enough seemed to be quite silent and deserted save for a few furtive plunderers hunting for food near tillingham they suddenly came in sight of the sea and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all sorts that it is possible to imagine
for after the sailors could no longer come up the thames they came on to the essex coast to harwich and walton and clacton and afterwards to foulness and shoebury to bring off the people they lay in a huge sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the naze close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—english scotch french dutch and swedish; steam launches from the thames yachts electric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden a multitude of filthy colliers trim merchantmen cattle ships passenger boats petroleum tanks ocean tramps an old white transport even neat white and grey liners from southampton and hamburg; and along the blue coast across the blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach a swarm which also extended up the blackwater almost to maldon
about a couple of miles out lay an ironclad very low in the water almost to my brothers perception like a water-logged ship this was the ram _thunder child_ it was the only warship in sight but far away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of the channel fleet which hovered in an extended line steam up and ready for action across the thames estuary during the course of the martian conquest vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it
at the sight of the sea mrs elphinstone in spite of the assurances of her sister-in-law gave way to panic she had never been out of england before she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a foreign country and so forth she seemed poor woman to imagine that the french and the martians might prove very similar she had been growing increasingly hysterical fearful and depressed during the two days journeyings her great idea was to return to stanmore things had been always well and safe at stanmore they would find george at stanmore
it was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the beach where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention of some men on a paddle steamer from the thames they sent a boat and drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three the steamer was going these men said to ostend
it was about two oclock when my brother having paid their fares at the gangway found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his charges there was food aboard albeit at exorbitant prices and the three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward
there were already a couple of score of passengers aboard some of whom had expended their last money in securing a passage but the captain lay off the blackwater until five in the afternoon picking up passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded he would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of guns that began about that hour in the south as if in answer the ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags a jet of smoke sprang out of her funnels
some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from shoeburyness until it was noticed that it was growing louder at the same time far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea beneath clouds of black smoke but my brothers attention speedily reverted to the distant firing in the south he fancied he saw a column of smoke rising out of the distant grey haze
the little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping and the low essex coast was growing blue and hazy when a martian appeared small and faint in the remote distance advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of foulness at that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay and the paddles seemed infected with his terror every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape higher than the trees or church towers inland and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride
it was the first martian my brother had seen and he stood more amazed than terrified watching this titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away then far away beyond the crouch came another striding over some stunted trees and then yet another still farther off wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky they were all stalking seaward as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between foulness and the naze in spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance
glancing northwestward my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind another another coming round from broadside to end on steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam sails being let out launches rushing hither and thither he was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward and then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing there was a shouting all about him a trampling of feet and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly the steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands
he sprang to his feet and saw to starboard and not a hundred yards from their heeling pitching boat a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer flinging her paddles helplessly in the air and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline
a douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment when his eyes were clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward big iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure and from that twin funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire it was the torpedo ram _thunder child_ steaming headlong coming to the rescue of the threatened shipping
keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks my brother looked past this charging leviathan at the martians again and he saw the three of them now close together and standing so far out to sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged thus sunken and seen in remote perspective they appeared far less formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was pitching so helplessly it would seem they were regarding this new antagonist with astonishment to their intelligence it may be the giant was even such another as themselves the _thunder child_ fired no gun but simply drove full speed towards them it was probably her not firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did they did not know what to make of her one shell and they would have sent her to the bottom forthwith with the heat-ray
she was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the martians—a diminishing black bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the essex coast
suddenly the foremost martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad it hit her larboard side and glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward an unfolding torrent of black smoke from which the ironclad drove clear to the watchers from the steamer low in the water and with the sun in their eyes it seemed as though she were already among the martians
they saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as they retreated shoreward and one of them raised the camera-like generator of the heat-ray he held it pointing obliquely downward and a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch it must have driven through the iron of the ships side like a white-hot iron rod through paper
a flicker of flame went up through the rising steam and then the martian reeled and staggered in another moment he was cut down and a great body of water and steam shot high in the air the guns of the _thunder child_ sounded through the reek going off one after the other and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north and smashed a smack to matchwood
but no one heeded that very much at the sight of the martians collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately and all the crowding passengers on the steamers stern shouted together and then they yelled again for surging out beyond the white tumult drove something long and black the flames streaming from its middle parts its ventilators and funnels spouting fire
she was alive still; the steering gear it seems was intact and her engines working she headed straight for a second martian and was within a hundred yards of him when the heat-ray came to bear then with a violent thud a blinding flash her decks her funnels leaped upward the martian staggered with the violence of her explosion and in another moment the flaming wreckage still driving forward with the impetus of its pace had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard my brother shouted involuntarily a boiling tumult of steam hid everything again
two yelled the captain everyone was shouting the whole steamer from end to end rang with frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea
the steam hung upon the water for many minutes hiding the third martian and the coast altogether and all this time the boat was paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last the confusion cleared the drifting bank of black vapour intervened and nothing of the _thunder child_ could be made out nor could the third martian be seen but the ironclads to seaward were now quite close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat
the little vessel continued to beat its way seaward and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour part steam part black gas eddying and combining in the strangest way the fleet of refugees was scattering to the northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the steamboat after a time and before they reached the sinking cloud bank the warships turned northward and then abruptly went about and passed into the thickening haze of evening southward the coast grew faint and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that were gathering about the sinking sun
then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns and a form of black shadows moving everyone struggled to the rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west but nothing was to be distinguished clearly a mass of smoke rose slanting and barred the face of the sun the steamboat throbbed on its way through an interminable suspense
the sun sank into grey clouds the sky flushed and darkened the evening star trembled into sight it was deep twilight when the captain cried out and pointed my brother strained his eyes something rushed up into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad and very large that swept round in a vast curve grew smaller sank slowly and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night and as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land
book two the earth under the martians
i under foot in the first book i have wandered so much from my own adventures to tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two chapters i and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at halliford whither we fled to escape the black smoke there i will resume we stopped there all sunday night and all the next day—the day of the panic—in a little island of daylight cut off by the black smoke from the rest of the world we could do nothing but wait in aching inactivity during those two weary days
my mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife i figured her at leatherhead terrified in danger mourning me already as a dead man i paced the rooms and cried aloud when i thought of how i was cut off from her of all that might happen to her in my absence my cousin i knew was brave enough for any emergency but he was not the sort of man to realise danger quickly to rise promptly what was needed now was not bravery but circumspection my only consolation was to believe that the martians were moving londonward and away from her such vague anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful i grew very weary and irritable with the curates perpetual ejaculations; i tired of the sight of his selfish despair after some ineffectual remonstrance i kept away from him staying in a room—evidently a childrens schoolroom—containing globes forms and copybooks when he followed me thither i went to a box room at the top of the house and in order to be alone with my aching miseries locked myself in
we were hopelessly hemmed in by the black smoke all that day and the morning of the next there were signs of people in the next house on sunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights and later the slamming of a door but i do not know who these people were nor what became of them we saw nothing of them next day the black smoke drifted slowly riverward all through monday morning creeping nearer and nearer to us driving at last along the roadway outside the house that hid us
a martian came across the fields about midday laying the stuff with a jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls smashed all the windows it touched and scalded the curates hand as he fled out of the front room when at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it looking towards the river we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows
for a time we did not see how this change affected our position save that we were relieved of our fear of the black smoke but later i perceived that we were no longer hemmed in that now we might get away so soon as i realised that the way of escape was open my dream of action returned but the curate was lethargic unreasonable
we are safe here he repeated; safe here
i resolved to leave him—would that i had wiser now for the artillerymans teaching i sought out food and drink i had found oil and rags for my burns and i also took a hat and a flannel shirt that i found in one of the bedrooms when it was clear to him that i meant to go alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused himself to come and all being quiet throughout the afternoon we started about five oclock as i should judge along the blackened road to sunbury
in sunbury and at intervals along the road were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes horses as well as men overturned carts and luggage all covered thickly with black dust that pall of cindery powder made me think of what i had read of the destruction of pompeii we got to hampton court without misadventure our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances and at hampton court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift we went through bushey park with its deer going to and fro under the chestnuts and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards hampton and so we came to twickenham these were the first people we saw
away across the road the woods beyond ham and petersham were still afire twickenham was uninjured by either heat-ray or black smoke and there were more people about here though none could give us news for the most part they were like ourselves taking advantage of a lull to shift their quarters i have an impression that many of the houses here were still occupied by scared inhabitants too frightened even for flight here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the road i remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap pounded into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts we crossed richmond bridge about half past eight we hurried across the exposed bridge of course but i noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses some many feet across i did not know what these were—there was no time for scrutiny—and i put a more horrible interpretation on them than they deserved here again on the surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station; but we had no glimpse of the martians until we were some way towards barnes
we saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a side street towards the river but otherwise it seemed deserted up the hill richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of richmond there was no trace of the black smoke
then suddenly as we approached kew came a number of people running and the upperworks of a martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over the housetops not a hundred yards away from us we stood aghast at our danger and had the martian looked down we must immediately have perished we were so terrified that we dared not go on but turned aside and hid in a shed in a garden there the curate crouched weeping silently and refusing to stir again
but my fixed idea of reaching leatherhead would not let me rest and in the twilight i ventured out again i went through a shrubbery and along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds and so emerged upon the road towards kew the curate i left in the shed but he came hurrying after me
that second start was the most foolhardy thing i ever did for it was manifest the martians were about us no sooner had the curate overtaken me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or another far away across the meadows in the direction of kew lodge four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field and in a moment it was evident this martian pursued them in three strides he was among them and they ran radiating from his feet in all directions he used no heat-ray to destroy them but picked them up one by one apparently he tossed them into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him much as a workmans basket hangs over his shoulder
it was the first time i realised that the martians might have any other purpose than destruction with defeated humanity we stood for a moment petrified then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled garden fell into rather than found a fortunate ditch and lay there scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out
i suppose it was nearly eleven oclock before we gathered courage to start again no longer venturing into the road but sneaking along hedgerows and through plantations and watching keenly through the darkness he on the right and i on the left for the martians who seemed to be all about us in one place we blundered upon a scorched and blackened area now cooling and ashen and a number of scattered dead bodies of men burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses fifty feet perhaps behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages
sheen it seemed had escaped destruction but the place was silent and deserted here we happened on no dead though the night was too dark for us to see into the side roads of the place in sheen my companion suddenly complained of faintness and thirst and we decided to try one of the houses
the first house we entered after a little difficulty with the window was a small semi-detached villa and i found nothing eatable left in the place but some mouldy cheese there was however water to drink; and i took a hatchet which promised to be useful in our next house-breaking
we then crossed to a place where the road turns towards mortlake here there stood a white house within a walled garden and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan an uncooked steak and the half of a ham i give this catalogue so precisely because as it happened we were destined to subsist upon this store for the next fortnight bottled beer stood under a shelf and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces this pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen and in this was firewood; there was also a cupboard in which we found nearly a dozen of burgundy tinned soups and salmon and two tins of biscuits
we sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a light—and ate bread and ham and drank beer out of the same bottle the curate who was still timorous and restless was now oddly enough for pushing on and i was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when the thing happened that was to imprison us
it cant be midnight yet i said and then came a blinding glare of vivid green light everything in the kitchen leaped out clearly visible in green and black and vanished again and then followed such a concussion as i have never heard before or since so close on the heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me a clash of glass a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us and the plaster of the ceiling came down upon us smashing into a multitude of fragments upon our heads i was knocked headlong across the floor against the oven handle and stunned i was insensible for a long time the curate told me and when i came to we were in darkness again and he with a face wet as i found afterwards with blood from a cut forehead was dabbing water over me
for some time i could not recollect what had happened then things came to me slowly a bruise on my temple asserted itself
are you better? asked the curate in a whisper
at last i answered him i sat up
dont move he said the floor is covered with smashed crockery from the dresser you cant possibly move without making a noise and i fancy _they_ are outside
we both sat quite silent so that we could scarcely hear each other breathing everything seemed deadly still but once something near us some plaster or broken brickwork slid down with a rumbling sound outside and very near was an intermittent metallic rattle
that said the curate when presently it happened again
yes i said but what is it?
a martian said the curate i listened again
it was not like the heat-ray i said and for a time i was inclined to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the house as i had seen one stumble against the tower of shepperton church
our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or four hours until the dawn came we scarcely moved and then the light filtered in not through the window which remained black but through a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the wall behind us the interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the first time
the window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet outside the soil was banked high against the house at the top of the window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe the floor was littered with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was broken into and since the daylight shone in there it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed contrasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser stained in the fashion pale green and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range
as the dawn grew clearer we saw through the gap in the wall the body of a martian standing sentinel i suppose over the still glowing cylinder at the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery
abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind
the fifth cylinder i whispered the fifth shot from mars has struck this house and buried us under the ruins
for a time the curate was silent and then he whispered:
god have mercy upon us i heard him presently whimpering to himself
save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; i for my part scarce dared breathe and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of the kitchen door i could just see the curates face a dim oval shape and his collar and cuffs outside there began a metallic hammering then a violent hooting and then again after a quiet interval a hissing like the hissing of an engine these noises for the most part problematical continued intermittently and seemed if anything to increase in number as time wore on presently a measured thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the vessels in the pantry ring and shift began and continued once the light was eclipsed and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely dark for many hours we must have crouched there silent and shivering until our tired attention failed   
at last i found myself awake and very hungry i am inclined to believe we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening my hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action i told the curate i was going to seek food and felt my way towards the pantry he made me no answer but so soon as i began eating the faint noise i made stirred him up and i heard him crawling after me
ii what we saw from the ruined house
after eating we crept back to the scullery and there i must have dozed again for when presently i looked round i was alone the thudding vibration continued with wearisome persistence i whispered for the curate several times and at last felt my way to the door of the kitchen it was still daylight and i perceived him across the room lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the martians his shoulders were hunched so that his head was hidden from me
i could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed; and the place rocked with that beating thud through the aperture in the wall i could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky for a minute or so i remained watching the curate and then i advanced crouching and stepping with extreme care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor
i touched the curates leg and he started so violently that a mass of plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact i gripped his arm fearing he might cry out and for a long time we crouched motionless then i turned to see how much of our rampart remained the detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open in the debris and by raising myself cautiously across a beam i was able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet suburban roadway vast indeed was the change that we beheld
the fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house we had first visited the building had vanished completely smashed pulverised and dispersed by the blow the cylinder lay now far beneath the original foundations—deep in a hole already vastly larger than the pit i had looked into at woking the earth all round it had splashed under that tremendous impact—splashed is the only word—and lay in heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses it had behaved exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer our house had collapsed backward; the front portion even on the ground floor had been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had escaped and stood buried now under soil and ruins closed in by tons of earth on every side save towards the cylinder over that aspect we hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the martians were engaged in making the heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole
the cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit and on the farther edge of the pit amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery one of the great fighting-machines deserted by its occupant stood stiff and tall against the evening sky at first i scarcely noticed the pit and the cylinder although it has been convenient to describe them first on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism i saw busy in the excavation and on account of the strange creatures that were crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it
the mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first it was one of those complicated fabrics that have since been called handling-machines and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention as it dawned upon me first it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed agile legs and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers bars and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body most of its arms were retracted but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods plates and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder these as it extracted them were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it
its motion was so swift complex and perfect that at first i did not see it as a machine in spite of its metallic glitter the fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary pitch but nothing to compare with this people who have never seen these structures and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon scarcely realise that living quality
i recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to give a consecutive account of the war the artist had evidently made a hasty study of one of the fighting-machines and there his knowledge ended he presented them as tilted stiff tripods without either flexibility or subtlety and with an altogether misleading monotony of effect the pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable vogue and i mention them here simply to warn the reader against the impression they may have created they were no more like the martians i saw in action than a dutch doll is like a human being to my mind the pamphlet would have been much better without them
at first i say the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument the controlling martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crabs cerebral portion but then i perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown shiny leathery integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond and the true nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me with that realisation my interest shifted to those other creatures the real martians already i had had a transient impression of these and the first nausea no longer obscured my observation moreover i was concealed and motionless and under no urgency of action
they were i now saw the most unearthly creatures it is possible to conceive they were huge round bodies—or rather heads—about four feet in diameter each body having in front of it a face this face had no nostrils—indeed the martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes and just beneath this a kind of fleshy beak in the back of this head or body—i scarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface since known to be anatomically an ear though it must have been almost useless in our dense air in a group round the mouth were sixteen slender almost whiplike tentacles arranged in two bunches of eight each these bunches have since been named rather aptly by that distinguished anatomist professor howes the _hands_ even as i saw these martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to raise themselves on these hands but of course with the increased weight of terrestrial conditions this was impossible there is reason to suppose that on mars they may have progressed upon them with some facility
the internal anatomy i may remark here as dissection has since shown was almost equally simple the greater part of the structure was the brain sending enormous nerves to the eyes ear and tactile tentacles besides this were the bulky lungs into which the mouth opened and the heart and its vessels the pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive movements of the outer skin
and this was the sum of the martian organs strange as it may seem to a human being all the complex apparatus of digestion which makes up the bulk of our bodies did not exist in the martians they were heads—merely heads entrails they had none they did not eat much less digest instead they took the fresh living blood of other creatures and _injected_ it into their own veins i have myself seen this being done as i shall mention in its place but squeamish as i may seem i cannot bring myself to describe what i could not endure even to continue watching let it suffice to say blood obtained from a still living animal in most cases from a human being was run directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal   
the bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us but at the same time i think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit
the physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process our bodies are half made up of glands and tubes and organs occupied in turning heterogeneous food into blood the digestive processes and their reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers or sound gastric glands but the martians were lifted above all these organic fluctuations of mood and emotion
their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had brought with them as provisions from mars these creatures to judge from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands were bipeds with flimsy silicious skeletons (almost like those of the silicious sponges) and feeble musculature standing about six feet high and having round erect heads and large eyes in flinty sockets two or three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder and all were killed before earth was reached it was just as well for them for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every bone in their bodies
and while i am engaged in this description i may add in this place certain further details which although they were not all evident to us at the time will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures
in three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours their organisms did not sleep any more than the heart of man sleeps since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate that periodical extinction was unknown to them they had little or no sense of fatigue it would seem on earth they could never have moved without effort yet even to the last they kept in action in twenty-four hours they did twenty-four hours of work as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants
in the next place wonderful as it seems in a sexual world the martians were absolutely without sex and therefore without any of the tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men a young martian there can now be no dispute was really born upon earth during the war and it was found attached to its parent partially _budded_ off just as young lilybulbs bud off or like the young animals in the fresh-water polyp
in man in all the higher terrestrial animals such a method of increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primitive method among the lower animals up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated animals the tunicates the two processes occur side by side but finally the sexual method superseded its competitor altogether on mars however just the reverse has apparently been the case
it is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of quasi-scientific repute writing long before the martian invasion did forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual martian condition his prophecy i remember appeared in november or december 1893 in a long-defunct publication the _pall mall budget_ and i recall a caricature of it in a pre-martian periodical called _punch_ he pointed out—writing in a foolish facetious tone—that the perfection of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the perfection of chemical devices digestion; that such organs as hair external nose teeth ears and chin were no longer essential parts of the human being and that the tendency of natural selection would lie in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages the brain alone remained a cardinal necessity only one other part of the body had a strong case for survival and that was the hand teacher and agent of the brain while the rest of the body dwindled the hands would grow larger
there is many a true word written in jest and here in the martians we have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of the animal side of the organism by the intelligence to me it is quite credible that the martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body without the body the brain would of course become a mere selfish intelligence without any of the emotional substratum of the human being
the last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular micro-organisms which cause so much disease and pain on earth have either never appeared upon mars or martian sanitary science eliminated them ages ago a hundred diseases all the fevers and contagions of human life consumption cancers tumours and such morbidities never enter the scheme of their life and speaking of the differences between the life on mars and terrestrial life i may allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed
apparently the vegetable kingdom in mars instead of having green for a dominant colour is of a vivid blood-red tint at any rate the seeds which the martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths only that known popularly as the red weed however gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms the red creeper was quite a transitory growth and few people have seen it growing for a time however the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance it spread up the sides of the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment and its cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our triangular window and afterwards i found it broadcast throughout the country and especially wherever there was a stream of water
the martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ a single round drum at the back of the head-body and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that according to philips blue and violet were as black to them it is commonly supposed that they communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted for instance in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written evidently by someone not an eye-witness of martian actions) to which i have already alluded and which so far has been the chief source of information concerning them now no surviving human being saw so much of the martians in action as i did i take no credit to myself for an accident but the fact is so and i assert that i watched them closely time after time and that i have seen four five and (once) six of them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations together without either sound or gesture their peculiar hooting invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation and was i believe in no sense a signal but merely the expiration of air preparatory to the suctional operation i have a certain claim to at least an elementary knowledge of psychology and in this matter i am convinced—as firmly as i am convinced of anything—that the martians interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation and i have been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions before the martian invasion as an occasional reader here or there may remember i had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory
the martians wore no clothing their conceptions of ornament and decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are but changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all seriously yet though they wore no clothing it was in the other artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great superiority over man lay we men with our bicycles and road-skates our lilienthal soaring-machines our guns and sticks and so forth are just in the beginning of the evolution that the martians have worked out they have become practically mere brains wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet and of their appliances perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism is absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels one would have at least expected it in locomotion and in this connection it is curious to remark that even on this earth nature has never hit upon the wheel or has preferred other expedients to its development and not only did the martians either not know of (which is incredible) or abstain from the wheel but in their apparatus singularly little use is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot with circular motions thereabout confined to one plane almost all the joints of the machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over small but beautifully curved friction bearings and while upon this matter of detail it is remarkable that the long leverages of their machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of electricity in this way the curious parallelism to animal motions which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder was attained such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine which on my first peeping out of the slit i watched unpacking the cylinder it seemed infinitely more alive than the actual martians lying beyond it in the sunset light panting stirring ineffectual tentacles and moving feebly after their vast journey across space
while i was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight and noting each strange detail of their form the curate reminded me of his presence by pulling violently at my arm i turned to a scowling face and silent eloquent lips he wanted the slit which permitted only one of us to peep through; and so i had to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege
when i looked again the busy handling-machine had already put together several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner this it was which had caused the regular beating noise and the rhythmic shocks that had kept our ruinous refuge quivering it piped and whistled as it worked so far as i could see the thing was without a directing martian at all
iii the days of imprisonment the arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole into the scullery for we feared that from his elevation the martian might see down upon us behind our barrier at a later date we began to feel less in danger of their eyes for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness but at first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery in heart-throbbing retreat yet terrible as was the danger we incurred the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible and i recall now with a sort of wonder that in spite of the infinite danger in which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death we could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight we would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and the dread of making a noise and strike each other and thrust and kick within a few inches of exposure
the fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits of thought and action and our danger and isolation only accentuated the incompatibility at halliford i had already come to hate the curates trick of helpless exclamation his stupid rigidity of mind his endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort i made to think out a line of action and drove me at times thus pent up and intensified almost to the verge of craziness he was as lacking in restraint as a silly woman he would weep for hours together and i verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought his weak tears in some way efficacious and i would sit in the darkness unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities he ate more than i did and it was in vain i pointed out that our only chance of life was to stop in the house until the martians had done with their pit that in that long patience a time might presently come when we should need food he ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long intervals he slept little
as the days wore on his utter carelessness of any consideration so intensified our distress and danger that i had much as i loathed doing it to resort to threats and at last to blows that brought him to reason for a time but he was one of those weak creatures void of pride timorous anæmic hateful souls full of shifty cunning who face neither god nor man who face not even themselves
it is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things but i set them down that my story may lack nothing those who have escaped the dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality my flash of rage in our final tragedy easy enough to blame; for they know what is wrong as well as any but not what is possible to tortured men but those who have been under the shadow who have gone down at last to elemental things will have a wider charity
and while within we fought out our dark dim contest of whispers snatched food and drink and gripping hands and blows without in the pitiless sunlight of that terrible june was the strange wonder the unfamiliar routine of the martians in the pit let me return to those first new experiences of mine after a long time i ventured back to the peephole to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines these last had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly manner about the cylinder the second handling-machine was now completed and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the big machine had brought this was a body resembling a milk can in its general form above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below
the oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the handling-machine with two spatulate hands the handling-machine was digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle above while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the mound of bluish dust from this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air as i looked the handling-machine with a faint and musical clinking extended telescopic fashion a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere blunt projection until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay in another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight untarnished as yet and shining dazzlingly and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit between sunset and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred such bars out of the crude clay and the mound of bluish dust rose steadily until it topped the side of the pit
the contrast between the swift and complex movements of these contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was acute and for days i had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter were indeed the living of the two things
the curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought to the pit i was sitting below huddled up listening with all my ears he made a sudden movement backward and i fearful that we were observed crouched in a spasm of terror he came sliding down the rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness inarticulate gesticulating and for a moment i shared his panic his gesture suggested a resignation of the slit and after a little while my curiosity gave me courage and i rose up stepped across him and clambered up to it at first i could see no reason for his frantic behaviour the twilight had now come the stars were little and faint but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making the whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows strangely trying to the eyes over and through it all went the bats heeding it not at all the sprawling martians were no longer to be seen the mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight and a fighting-machine with its legs contracted crumpled and abbreviated stood across the corner of the pit and then amid the clangour of the machinery came a drifting suspicion of human voices that i entertained at first only to dismiss
i crouched watching this fighting-machine closely satisfying myself now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a martian as the green flames lifted i could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes and suddenly i heard a yell and saw a long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunched upon its back then something—something struggling violently—was lifted high against the sky a black vague enigma against the starlight; and as this black object came down again i saw by the green brightness that it was a man for an instant he was clearly visible he was a stout ruddy middle-aged man well dressed; three days before he must have been walking the world a man of considerable consequence i could see his staring eyes and gleams of light on his studs and watch chain he vanished behind the mound and for a moment there was silence and then began a shrieking and a sustained and cheerful hooting from the martians
i slid down the rubbish struggled to my feet clapped my hands over my ears and bolted into the scullery the curate who had been crouching silently with his arms over his head looked up as i passed cried out quite loudly at my desertion of him and came running after me
that night as we lurked in the scullery balanced between our horror and the terrible fascination this peeping had although i felt an urgent need of action i tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape; but afterwards during the second day i was able to consider our position with great clearness the curate i found was quite incapable of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all vestiges of reason or forethought practically he had already sunk to the level of an animal but as the saying goes i gripped myself with both hands it grew upon my mind once i could face the facts that terrible as our position was there was as yet no justification for absolute despair our chief chance lay in the possibility of the martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment or even if they kept it permanently they might not consider it necessary to guard it and a chance of escape might be afforded us i also weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a direction away from the pit but the chances of our emerging within sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great and i should have had to do all the digging myself the curate would certainly have failed me
it was on the third day if my memory serves me right that i saw the lad killed it was the only occasion on which i actually saw the martians feed after that experience i avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a day i went into the scullery removed the door and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible; but when i had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth collapsed noisily and i did not dare continue i lost heart and lay down on the scullery floor for a long time having no spirit even to move and after that i abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by excavation
it says much for the impression the martians had made upon me that at first i entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about by their overthrow through any human effort but on the fourth or fifth night i heard a sound like heavy guns
it was very late in the night and the moon was shining brightly the martians had taken away the excavating-machine and save for a fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit immediately beneath my peephole the place was deserted by them except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness and except for the clinking of the handling-machine quite still that night was a beautiful serenity; save for one planet the moon seemed to have the sky to herself i heard a dog howling and that familiar sound it was that made me listen then i heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like the sound of great guns six distinct reports i counted and after a long interval six again and that was all
iv the death of the curate
it was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that i peeped for the last time and presently found myself alone instead of keeping close to me and trying to oust me from the slit the curate had gone back into the scullery i was struck by a sudden thought i went back quickly and quietly into the scullery in the darkness i heard the curate drinking i snatched in the darkness and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy
for a few minutes there was a tussle the bottle struck the floor and broke and i desisted and rose we stood panting and threatening each other in the end i planted myself between him and the food and told him of my determination to begin a discipline i divided the food in the pantry into rations to last us ten days i would not let him eat any more that day in the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at the food i had been dozing but in an instant i was awake all day and all night we sat face to face i weary but resolute and he weeping and complaining of his immediate hunger it was i know a night and a day but to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time
and so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict for two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests there were times when i beat and kicked him madly times when i cajoled and persuaded him and once i tried to bribe him with the last bottle of burgundy for there was a rain-water pump from which i could get water but neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason he would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy babbling to himself the rudimentary precautions to keep our imprisonment endurable he would not observe slowly i began to realise the complete overthrow of his intelligence to perceive that my sole companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane
from certain vague memories i am inclined to think my own mind wandered at times i had strange and hideous dreams whenever i slept it sounds paradoxical but i am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity of the curate warned me braced me and kept me a sane man
on the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering and nothing i could do would moderate his speech
it is just o god he would say over and over again it is just on me and mine be the punishment laid we have sinned we have fallen short there was poverty sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust and i held my peace i preached acceptable folly—my god what folly—when i should have stood up though i died for it and called upon them to repent—repent    oppressors of the poor and needy     the wine press of god
then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food i withheld from him praying begging weeping at last threatening he began to raise his voice—i prayed him not to he perceived a hold on me—he threatened he would shout and bring the martians upon us for a time that scared me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond estimating i defied him although i felt no assurance that he might not do this thing but that day at any rate he did not he talked with his voice rising slowly through the greater part of the eighth and ninth days—threats entreaties mingled with a torrent of half-sane and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of gods service such as made me pity him then he slept awhile and began again with renewed strength so loudly that i must needs make him desist
be still i implored he rose to his knees for he had been sitting in the darkness near the copper
i have been still too long he said in a tone that must have reached the pit and now i must bear my witness woe unto this unfaithful city woe woe woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet——
shut up i said rising to my feet and in a terror lest the martians should hear us for gods sake——
nay shouted the curate at the top of his voice standing likewise and extending his arms speak the word of the lord is upon me
in three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen
i must bear my witness i go it has already been too long delayed
i put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall in a flash i was after him i was fierce with fear before he was halfway across the kitchen i had overtaken him with one last touch of humanity i turned the blade back and struck him with the butt he went headlong forward and lay stretched on the ground i stumbled over him and stood panting he lay still
suddenly i heard a noise without the run and smash of slipping plaster and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened i looked up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across the hole one of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another limb appeared feeling its way over the fallen beams i stood petrified staring then i saw through a sort of glass plate near the edge of the body the face as we may call it and the large dark eyes of a martian peering and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came feeling slowly through the hole
i turned by an effort stumbled over the curate and stopped at the scullery door the tentacle was now some way two yards or more in the room and twisting and turning with queer sudden movements this way and that for a while i stood fascinated by that slow fitful advance then with a faint hoarse cry i forced myself across the scullery i trembled violently; i could scarcely stand upright i opened the door of the coal cellar and stood there in the darkness staring at the faintly lit doorway into the kitchen and listening had the martian seen me? what was it doing now?
something was moving to and fro there very quietly; every now and then it tapped against the wall or started on its movements with a faint metallic ringing like the movements of keys on a split-ring then a heavy body—i knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the kitchen towards the opening irresistibly attracted i crept to the door and peeped into the kitchen in the triangle of bright outer sunlight i saw the martian in its briareus of a handling-machine scrutinizing the curates head i thought at once that it would infer my presence from the mark of the blow i had given him
i crept back to the coal cellar shut the door and began to cover myself up as much as i could and as noiselessly as possible in the darkness among the firewood and coal therein every now and then i paused rigid to hear if the martian had thrust its tentacles through the opening again
then the faint metallic jingle returned i traced it slowly feeling over the kitchen presently i heard it nearer—in the scullery as i judged i thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me i prayed copiously it passed scraping faintly across the cellar door an age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then i heard it fumbling at the latch it had found the door the martians understood doors
it worried at the catch for a minute perhaps and then the door opened
in the darkness i could just see the thing—like an elephants trunk more than anything else—waving towards me and touching and examining the wall coals wood and ceiling it was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro
once even it touched the heel of my boot i was on the verge of screaming; i bit my hand for a time the tentacle was silent i could have fancied it had been withdrawn presently with an abrupt click it gripped something—i thought it had me—and seemed to go out of the cellar again for a minute i was not sure apparently it had taken a lump of coal to examine
i seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position which had become cramped and then listened i whispered passionate prayers for safety
then i heard the slow deliberate sound creeping towards me again slowly slowly it drew near scratching against the walls and tapping the furniture
while i was still doubtful it rapped smartly against the cellar door and closed it i heard it go into the pantry and the biscuit-tins rattled and a bottle smashed and then came a heavy bump against the cellar door then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense
had it gone? at last i decided that it had
it came into the scullery no more; but i lay all the tenth day in the close darkness buried among coals and firewood not daring even to crawl out for the drink for which i craved it was the eleventh day before i ventured so far from my security
v the stillness my first act before i went into the pantry was to fasten the door between the kitchen and the scullery but the pantry was empty; every scrap of food had gone apparently the martian had taken it all on the previous day at that discovery i despaired for the first time i took no food or no drink either on the eleventh or the twelfth day
at first my mouth and throat were parched and my strength ebbed sensibly i sat about in the darkness of the scullery in a state of despondent wretchedness my mind ran on eating i thought i had become deaf for the noises of movement i had been accustomed to hear from the pit had ceased absolutely i did not feel strong enough to crawl noiselessly to the peephole or i would have gone there
on the twelfth day my throat was so painful that taking the chance of alarming the martians i attacked the creaking rain-water pump that stood by the sink and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and tainted rain water i was greatly refreshed by this and emboldened by the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping
during these days in a rambling inconclusive way i thought much of the curate and of the manner of his death
on the thirteenth day i drank some more water and dozed and thought disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape whenever i dozed i dreamt of horrible phantasms of the death of the curate or of sumptuous dinners; but asleep or awake i felt a keen pain that urged me to drink again and again the light that came into the scullery was no longer grey but red to my disordered imagination it seemed the colour of blood
on the fourteenth day i went into the kitchen and i was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity
it was early on the fifteenth day that i heard a curious familiar sequence of sounds in the kitchen and listening identified it as the snuffing and scratching of a dog going into the kitchen i saw a dogs nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds this greatly surprised me at the scent of me he barked shortly
i thought if i could induce him to come into the place quietly i should be able perhaps to kill and eat him; and in any case it would be advisable to kill him lest his actions attracted the attention of the martians
i crept forward saying good dog very softly; but he suddenly withdrew his head and disappeared
i listened—i was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still i heard a sound like the flutter of a birds wings and a hoarse croaking but that was all
for a long while i lay close to the peephole but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it once or twice i heard a faint pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the sand far below me and there were more birdlike sounds but that was all at length encouraged by the silence i looked out
except in the corner where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over the skeletons of the dead the martians had consumed there was not a living thing in the pit
i stared about me scarcely believing my eyes all the machinery had gone save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner certain bars of aluminium in another the black birds and the skeletons of the killed the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand
slowly i thrust myself out through the red weed and stood upon the mound of rubble i could see in any direction save behind me to the north and neither martians nor sign of martians were to be seen the pit dropped sheerly from my feet but a little way along the rubbish afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins my chance of escape had come i began to tremble
i hesitated for some time and then in a gust of desperate resolution and with a heart that throbbed violently i scrambled to the top of the mound in which i had been buried so long
i looked about again to the northward too no martian was visible
when i had last seen this part of sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses interspersed with abundant shady trees now i stood on a mound of smashed brickwork clay and gravel over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants knee-high without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing the trees near me were dead and brown but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems
the neighbouring houses had all been wrecked but none had been burned; their walls stood sometimes to the second story with smashed windows and shattered doors the red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms below me was the great pit with the crows struggling for its refuse a number of other birds hopped about among the ruins far away i saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall but traces of men there were none
the day seemed by contrast with my recent confinement dazzlingly bright the sky a glowing blue a gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying and oh the sweetness of the air
vi the work of fifteen days
for some time i stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety within that noisome den from which i had emerged i had thought with a narrow intensity only of our immediate security i had not realised what had been happening to the world had not anticipated this startling vision of unfamiliar things i had expected to see sheen in ruins—i found about me the landscape weird and lurid of another planet
for that moment i touched an emotion beyond the common range of men yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well i felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house i felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind that oppressed me for many days a sense of dethronement a persuasion that i was no longer a master but an animal among the animals under the martian heel with us it would be as with them to lurk and watch to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away
but so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed and my dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast in the direction away from the pit i saw beyond a red-covered wall a patch of garden ground unburied this gave me a hint and i went knee-deep and sometimes neck-deep in the red weed the density of the weed gave me a reassuring sense of hiding the wall was some six feet high and when i attempted to clamber it i found i could not lift my feet to the crest so i went along by the side of it and came to a corner and a rockwork that enabled me to get to the top and tumble into the garden i coveted here i found some young onions a couple of gladiolus bulbs and a quantity of immature carrots all of which i secured and scrambling over a ruined wall went on my way through scarlet and crimson trees towards kew—it was like walking through an avenue of gigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food and to limp as soon and as far as my strength permitted out of this accursed unearthly region of the pit
some way farther in a grassy place was a group of mushrooms which also i devoured and then i came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water where meadows used to be these fragments of nourishment served only to whet my hunger at first i was surprised at this flood in a hot dry summer but afterwards i discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed directly this extraordinary growth encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled fecundity its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the wey and thames and its swiftly growing and titanic water fronds speedily choked both those rivers
at putney as i afterwards saw the bridge was almost lost in a tangle of this weed and at richmond too the thames water poured in a broad and shallow stream across the meadows of hampton and twickenham as the water spread the weed followed them until the ruined villas of the thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp whose margin i explored and much of the desolation the martians had caused was concealed
in the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread a cankering disease due it is believed to the action of certain bacteria presently seized upon it now by the action of natural selection all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe struggle but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead the fronds became bleached and then shrivelled and brittle they broke off at the least touch and the waters that had stimulated their early growth carried their last vestiges out to sea
my first act on coming to this water was of course to slake my thirst i drank a great deal of it and moved by an impulse gnawed some fronds of red weed; but they were watery and had a sickly metallic taste i found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the flood evidently got deeper towards the river and i turned back to mortlake i managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins of its villas and fences and lamps and so presently i got out of this spate and made my way to the hill going up towards roehampton and came out on putney common
here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation of a cyclone and in a few score yards i would come upon perfectly undisturbed spaces houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors closed as if they had been left for a day by the owners or as if their inhabitants slept within the red weed was less abundant; the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper i hunted for food among the trees finding nothing and i also raided a couple of silent houses but they had already been broken into and ransacked i rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery being in my enfeebled condition too fatigued to push on
all this time i saw no human beings and no signs of the martians i encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs but both hurried circuitously away from the advances i made them near roehampton i had seen two human skeletons—not bodies but skeletons picked clean—and in the wood by me i found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats and rabbits and the skull of a sheep but though i gnawed parts of these in my mouth there was nothing to be got from them
after sunset i struggled on along the road towards putney where i think the heat-ray must have been used for some reason and in the garden beyond roehampton i got a quantity of immature potatoes sufficient to stay my hunger from this garden one looked down upon putney and the river the aspect of the place in the dusk was singularly desolate: blackened trees blackened desolate ruins and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river red-tinged with the weed and over all—silence it filled me with indescribable terror to think how swiftly that desolating change had come
for a time i believed that mankind had been swept out of existence and that i stood there alone the last man left alive hard by the top of putney hill i came upon another skeleton with the arms dislocated and removed several yards from the rest of the body as i proceeded i became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was save for such stragglers as myself already accomplished in this part of the world the martians i thought had gone on and left the country desolated seeking food elsewhere perhaps even now they were destroying berlin or paris or it might be they had gone northward
vii the man on putney hill
i spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of putney hill sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to leatherhead i will not tell the needless trouble i had breaking into that house—afterwards i found the front door was on the latch—nor how i ransacked every room for food until just on the verge of despair in what seemed to me to be a servants bedroom i found a rat-gnawed crust and two tins of pineapple the place had been already searched and emptied in the bar i afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches that had been overlooked the latter i could not eat they were too rotten but the former not only stayed my hunger but filled my pockets i lit no lamps fearing some martian might come beating that part of london for food in the night before i went to bed i had an interval of restlessness and prowled from window to window peering out for some sign of these monsters i slept little as i lay in bed i found myself thinking consecutively—a thing i do not remember to have done since my last argument with the curate during all the intervening time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity but in the night my brain reinforced i suppose by the food i had eaten grew clear again and i thought
three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the curate the whereabouts of the martians and the possible fate of my wife the former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; i saw it simply as a thing done a memory infinitely disagreeable but quite without the quality of remorse i saw myself then as i see myself now driven step by step towards that hasty blow the creature of a sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that i felt no condemnation; yet the memory static unprogressive haunted me in the silence of the night with that sense of the nearness of god that sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness i stood my trial my only trial for that moment of wrath and fear i retraced every step of our conversation from the moment when i had found him crouching beside me heedless of my thirst and pointing to the fire and smoke that streamed up from the ruins of weybridge we had been incapable of co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that had i foreseen i should have left him at halliford but i did not foresee; and crime is to foresee and do and i set this down as i have set all this story down as it was there were no witnesses—all these things i might have concealed but i set it down and the reader must form his judgment as he will
and when by an effort i had set aside that picture of a prostrate body i faced the problem of the martians and the fate of my wife for the former i had no data; i could imagine a hundred things and so unhappily i could for the latter and suddenly that night became terrible i found myself sitting up in bed staring at the dark i found myself praying that the heat-ray might have suddenly and painlessly struck her out of being since the night of my return from leatherhead i had not prayed i had uttered prayers fetish prayers had prayed as heathens mutter charms when i was in extremity; but now i prayed indeed pleading steadfastly and sanely face to face with the darkness of god strange night strangest in this that so soon as dawn had come i who had talked with god crept out of the house like a rat leaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger an inferior animal a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be hunted and killed perhaps they also prayed confidently to god surely if we have learned nothing else this war has taught us pity—pity for those witless souls that suffer our dominion
the morning was bright and fine and the eastern sky glowed pink and was fretted with little golden clouds in the road that runs from the top of putney hill to wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the panic torrent that must have poured londonward on the sunday night after the fighting began there was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed with the name of thomas lobb greengrocer new malden with a smashed wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into the now hardened mud and at the top of west hill a lot of blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough my movements were languid my plans of the vaguest i had an idea of going to leatherhead though i knew that there i had the poorest chance of finding my wife certainly unless death had overtaken them suddenly my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me i might find or learn there whither the surrey people had fled i knew i wanted to find my wife that my heart ached for her and the world of men but i had no clear idea how the finding might be done i was also sharply aware now of my intense loneliness from the corner i went under cover of a thicket of trees and bushes to the edge of wimbledon common stretching wide and far
that dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there was no red weed to be seen and as i prowled hesitating on the verge of the open the sun rose flooding it all with light and vitality i came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the trees i stopped to look at them drawing a lesson from their stout resolve to live and presently turning suddenly with an odd feeling of being watched i beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes i stood regarding this i made a step towards it and it rose up and became a man armed with a cutlass i approached him slowly he stood silent and motionless regarding me
as i drew nearer i perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and filthy as my own; he looked indeed as though he had been dragged through a culvert nearer i distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny coaly patches his black hair fell over his eyes and his face was dark and dirty and sunken so that at first i did not recognise him there was a red cut across the lower part of his face
stop he cried when i was within ten yards of him and i stopped his voice was hoarse where do you come from? he said
i thought surveying him i come from mortlake i said i was buried near the pit the martians made about their cylinder i have worked my way out and escaped
there is no food about here he said this is my country all this hill down to the river and back to clapham and up to the edge of the common there is only food for one which way are you going?
i answered slowly i dont know i said i have been buried in the ruins of a house thirteen or fourteen days i dont know what has happened
he looked at me doubtfully then started and looked with a changed expression
ive no wish to stop about here said i i think i shall go to leatherhead for my wife was there
he shot out a pointing finger
it is you said he; the man from woking and you werent killed at weybridge?
i recognised him at the same moment
you are the artilleryman who came into my garden
good luck he said we are lucky ones fancy _you_ he put out a hand and i took it i crawled up a drain he said but they didnt kill everyone and after they went away i got off towards walton across the fields but—— its not sixteen days altogether—and your hair is grey he looked over his shoulder suddenly only a rook he said one gets to know that birds have shadows these days this is a bit open let us crawl under those bushes and talk
have you seen any martians? i said since i crawled out——
theyve gone away across london he said i guess theyve got a bigger camp there of a night all over there hampstead way the sky is alive with their lights its like a great city and in the glare you can just see them moving by daylight you cant but nearer—i havent seen them— (he counted on his fingers) five days then i saw a couple across hammersmith way carrying something big and the night before last—he stopped and spoke impressively—it was just a matter of lights but it was something up in the air i believe theyve built a flying-machine and are learning to fly
i stopped on hands and knees for we had come to the bushes
fly yes he said fly i went on into a little bower and sat down
it is all over with humanity i said if they can do that they will simply go round the world
he nodded they will but—— it will relieve things over here a bit and besides—— he looked at me arent you satisfied it _is_ up with humanity? i am were down; were beat
i stared strange as it may seem i had not arrived at this fact—a fact perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke i had still held a vague hope; rather i had kept a lifelong habit of mind he repeated his words were beat they carried absolute conviction
its all over he said theyve lost _one_—just _one_ and theyve made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world theyve walked over us the death of that one at weybridge was an accident and these are only pioneers they kept on coming these green stars—ive seen none these five or six days but ive no doubt theyre falling somewhere every night nothings to be done were under were beat
i made him no answer i sat staring before me trying in vain to devise some countervailing thought
this isnt a war said the artilleryman it never was a war any more than theres war between man and ants
suddenly i recalled the night in the observatory
after the tenth shot they fired no more—at least until the first cylinder came
how do you know? said the artilleryman i explained he thought something wrong with the gun he said but what if there is? theyll get it right again and even if theres a delay how can it alter the end? its just men and ants theres the ants builds their cities live their lives have wars revolutions until the men want them out of the way and then they go out of the way thats what we are now—just ants only——
yes i said were eatable ants
we sat looking at each other
and what will they do with us? i said
thats what ive been thinking he said; thats what ive been thinking after weybridge i went south—thinking i saw what was up most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves but im not so fond of squealing ive been in sight of death once or twice; im not an ornamental soldier and at the best and worst death—its just death and its the man that keeps on thinking comes through i saw everyone tracking away south says i food wont last this way and i turned right back i went for the martians like a sparrow goes for man all round—he waved a hand to the horizon—theyre starving in heaps bolting treading on each other   
he saw my face and halted awkwardly
no doubt lots who had money have gone away to france he said he seemed to hesitate whether to apologise met my eyes and went on: theres food all about here canned things in shops; wines spirits mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty well i was telling you what i was thinking heres intelligent things i said and it seems they want us for food first theyll smash us up—ships machines guns cities all the order and organisation all that will go if we were the size of ants we might pull through but were not its all too bulky to stop thats the first certainty eh?
i assented it is; ive thought it out very well then—next; at present were caught as were wanted a martian has only to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run and i saw one one day out by wandsworth picking houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage but they wont keep on doing that so soon as theyve settled all our guns and ships and smashed our railways and done all the things they are doing over there they will begin catching us systematic picking the best and storing us in cages and things thats what they will start doing in a bit lord they havent begun on us yet dont you see that?
not begun i exclaimed not begun all thats happened so far is through our not having the sense to keep quiet—worrying them with guns and such foolery and losing our heads and rushing off in crowds to where there wasnt any more safety than where we were they dont want to bother us yet theyre making their things—making all the things they couldnt bring with them getting things ready for the rest of their people very likely thats why the cylinders have stopped for a bit for fear of hitting those who are here and instead of our rushing about blind on the howl or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up weve got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs thats how i figure it out it isnt quite according to what a man wants for his species but its about what the facts point to and thats the principle i acted upon cities nations civilisation progress—its all over that games up were beat
but if that is so what is there to live for?
the artilleryman looked at me for a moment
there wont be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so; there wont be any royal academy of arts and no nice little feeds at restaurants if its amusement youre after i reckon the game is up if youve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with a knife or dropping aitches youd better chuck em away they aint no further use
you mean—— i mean that men like me are going on living—for the sake of the breed i tell you im grim set on living and if im not mistaken youll show what insides _youve_ got too before long we arent going to be exterminated and i dont mean to be caught either and tamed and fattened and bred like a thundering ox ugh fancy those brown creepers
you dont mean to say—— i do im going on under their feet ive got it planned; ive thought it out we men are beat we dont know enough weve got to learn before weve got a chance and weve got to live and keep independent while we learn see thats what has to be done
i stared astonished and stirred profoundly by the mans resolution
great god cried i but you are a man indeed and suddenly i gripped his hand
eh he said with his eyes shining ive thought it out eh?
go on i said well those who mean to escape their catching must get ready im getting ready mind you it isnt all of us that are made for wild beasts; and thats what its got to be thats why i watched you i had my doubts youre slender i didnt know that it was you you see or just how youd been buried all these—the sort of people that lived in these houses and all those damn little clerks that used to live down _that_ way—theyd be no good they havent any spirit in them—no proud dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasnt one or the other—lord what is he but funk and precautions? they just used to skedaddle off to work—ive seen hundreds of em bit of breakfast in hand running wild and shining to catch their little season-ticket train for fear theyd get dismissed if they didnt; working at businesses they were afraid to take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldnt be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the back streets and sleeping with the wives they married not because they wanted them but because they had a bit of money that would make for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents and on sundays—fear of the hereafter as if hell was built for rabbits well the martians will just be a godsend to these nice roomy cages fattening food careful breeding no worry after a week or so chasing about the fields and lands on empty stomachs theyll come and be caught cheerful theyll be quite glad after a bit theyll wonder what people did before there were martians to take care of them and the bar loafers and mashers and singers—i can imagine them i can imagine them he said with a sort of sombre gratification therell be any amount of sentiment and religion loose among them theres hundreds of things i saw with my eyes that ive only begun to see clearly these last few days theres lots will take things as they are—fat and stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that its all wrong and that they ought to be doing something now whenever things are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something the weak and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking always make for a sort of do-nothing religion very pious and superior and submit to persecution and the will of the lord very likely youve seen the same thing its energy in a gale of funk and turned clean inside out these cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety and those of a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it?—eroticism
he paused very likely these martians will make pets of some of them; train them to do tricks—who knows?—get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed and some maybe they will train to hunt us
no i cried thats impossible no human being——
whats the good of going on with such lies? said the artilleryman theres men whod do it cheerful what nonsense to pretend there isnt
and i succumbed to his conviction
if they come after me he said; lord if they come after me and subsided into a grim meditation
i sat contemplating these things i could find nothing to bring against this mans reasoning in the days before the invasion no one would have questioned my intellectual superiority to his—i a professed and recognised writer on philosophical themes and he a common soldier; and yet he had already formulated a situation that i had scarcely realised
what are you doing? i said presently what plans have you made?
he hesitated well its like this he said what have we to do? we have to invent a sort of life where men can live and breed and be sufficiently secure to bring the children up yes—wait a bit and ill make it clearer what i think ought to be done the tame ones will go like all tame beasts; in a few generations theyll be big beautiful rich-blooded stupid—rubbish the risk is that we who keep wild will go savage—degenerate into a sort of big savage rat    you see how i mean to live is underground ive been thinking about the drains of course those who dont know drains think horrible things; but under this london are miles and miles—hundreds of miles—and a few days rain and london empty will leave them sweet and clean the main drains are big enough and airy enough for anyone then theres cellars vaults stores from which bolting passages may be made to the drains and the railway tunnels and subways eh? you begin to see? and we form a band—able-bodied clean-minded men were not going to pick up any rubbish that drifts in weaklings go out again
as you meant me to go?
well—i parleyed didnt i? we wont quarrel about that go on
those who stop obey orders able-bodied clean-minded women we want also—mothers and teachers no lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling eyes we cant have any weak or silly life is real again and the useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die they ought to die they ought to be willing to die its a sort of disloyalty after all to live and taint the race and they cant be happy moreover dyings none so dreadful; its the funking makes it bad and in all those places we shall gather our district will be london and we may even be able to keep a watch and run about in the open when the martians keep away play cricket perhaps thats how we shall save the race eh? its a possible thing? but saving the race is nothing in itself as i say thats only being rats its saving our knowledge and adding to it is the thing there men like you come in theres books theres models we must make great safe places down deep and get all the books we can; not novels and poetry swipes but ideas science books thats where men like you come in we must go to the british museum and pick all those books through especially we must keep up our science—learn more we must watch these martians some of us must go as spies when its all working perhaps i will get caught i mean and the great thing is we must leave the martians alone we mustnt even steal if we get in their way we clear out we must show them we mean no harm yes i know but theyre intelligent things and they wont hunt us down if they have all they want and think were just harmless vermin
the artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm
after all it may not be so much we may have to learn before—just imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting off—heat-rays right and left and not a martian in em not a martian in em but men—men who have learned the way how it may be in my time even—those men fancy having one of them lovely things with its heat-ray wide and free fancy having it in control what would it matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run after a bust like that? i reckon the martiansll open their beautiful eyes cant you see them man? cant you see them hurrying hurrying—puffing and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? something out of gear in every case and swish bang rattle swish just as they are fumbling over it _swish_ comes the heat-ray and behold man has come back to his own
for a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman and the tone of assurance and courage he assumed completely dominated my mind i believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in the practicability of his astonishing scheme and the reader who thinks me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position reading steadily with all his thoughts about his subject and mine crouching fearfully in the bushes and listening distracted by apprehension we talked in this manner through the early morning time and later crept out of the bushes and after scanning the sky for martians hurried precipitately to the house on putney hill where he had made his lair it was the coal cellar of the place and when i saw the work he had spent a week upon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long which he designed to reach to the main drain on putney hill—i had my first inkling of the gulf between his dreams and his powers such a hole i could have dug in a day but i believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that morning until past midday at his digging we had a garden barrow and shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range we refreshed ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring pantry i found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the world in this steady labour as we worked i turned his project over in my mind and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but i worked there all the morning so glad was i to find myself with a purpose again after working an hour i began to speculate on the distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached the chances we had of missing it altogether my immediate trouble was why we should dig this long tunnel when it was possible to get into the drain at once down one of the manholes and work back to the house it seemed to me too that the house was inconveniently chosen and required a needless length of tunnel and just as i was beginning to face these things the artilleryman stopped digging and looked at me
were working well he said he put down his spade let us knock off a bit he said i think its time we reconnoitred from the roof of the house
i was for going on and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade; and then suddenly i was struck by a thought i stopped and so did he at once
why were you walking about the common i said instead of being here?
taking the air he said i was coming back its safer by night
but the work? oh one cant always work he said and in a flash i saw the man plain he hesitated holding his spade we ought to reconnoitre now he said because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop upon us unawares
i was no longer disposed to object we went together to the roof and stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door no martians were to be seen and we ventured out on the tiles and slipped down under shelter of the parapet
from this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of putney but we could see the river below a bubbly mass of red weed and the low parts of lambeth flooded and red the red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace and their branches stretched gaunt and dead and set with shrivelled leaves from amid its clusters it was strange how entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their propagation about us neither had gained a footing; laburnums pink mays snowballs and trees of arbor-vitae rose out of laurels and hydrangeas green and brilliant into the sunlight beyond kensington dense smoke was rising and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills
the artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still remained in london
one night last week he said some fools got the electric light in order and there was all regent street and the circus ablaze crowded with painted and ragged drunkards men and women dancing and shouting till dawn a man who was there told me and as the day came they became aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the langham and looking down at them heaven knows how long he had been there it must have given some of them a nasty turn he came down the road towards them and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away
grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe
from that in answer to my questions he came round to his grandiose plans again he grew enthusiastic he talked so eloquently of the possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that i more than half believed in him again but now that i was beginning to understand something of his quality i could divine the stress he laid on doing nothing precipitately and i noted that now there was no question that he personally was to capture and fight the great machine
after a time we went down to the cellar neither of us seemed disposed to resume digging and when he suggested a meal i was nothing loath he became suddenly very generous and when we had eaten he went away and returned with some excellent cigars we lit these and his optimism glowed he was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion
theres some champagne in the cellar he said
we can dig better on this thames-side burgundy said i
no said he; i am host today champagne great god weve a heavy enough task before us let us take a rest and gather strength while we may look at these blistered hands
and pursuant to this idea of a holiday he insisted upon playing cards after we had eaten he taught me euchre and after dividing london between us i taking the northern side and he the southern we played for parish points grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober reader it is absolutely true and what is more remarkable i found the card game and several others we played extremely interesting
strange mind of man that with our species upon the edge of extermination or appalling degradation with no clear prospect before us but the chance of a horrible death we could sit following the chance of this painted pasteboard and playing the joker with vivid delight afterwards he taught me poker and i beat him at three tough chess games when dark came we decided to take the risk and lit a lamp
after an interminable string of games we supped and the artilleryman finished the champagne we went on smoking the cigars he was no longer the energetic regenerator of his species i had encountered in the morning he was still optimistic but it was a less kinetic a more thoughtful optimism i remember he wound up with my health proposed in a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence i took a cigar and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken that blazed so greenly along the highgate hills
at first i stared unintelligently across the london valley the northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near kensington glowed redly and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night all the rest of london was black then nearer i perceived a strange light a pale violet-purple fluorescent glow quivering under the night breeze for a space i could not understand it and then i knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded with that realisation my dormant sense of wonder my sense of the proportion of things awoke again i glanced from that to mars red and clear glowing high in the west and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of hampstead and highgate
i remained a very long time upon the roof wondering at the grotesque changes of the day i recalled my mental states from the midnight prayer to the foolish card-playing i had a violent revulsion of feeling i remember i flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful symbolism my folly came to me with glaring exaggeration i seemed a traitor to my wife and to my kind; i was filled with remorse i resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to his drink and gluttony and to go on into london there it seemed to me i had the best chance of learning what the martians and my fellowmen were doing i was still upon the roof when the late moon rose
viii dead london after i had parted from the artilleryman i went down the hill and by the high street across the bridge to fulham the red weed was tumultuous at that time and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that presently removed it so swiftly
at the corner of the lane that runs to putney bridge station i found a man lying he was as black as a sweep with the black dust alive but helplessly and speechlessly drunk i could get nothing from him but curses and furious lunges at my head i think i should have stayed by him but for the brutal expression of his face
there was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards and it grew thicker in fulham the streets were horribly quiet i got food—sour hard and mouldy but quite eatable—in a bakers shop here some way towards walham green the streets became clear of powder and i passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was an absolute relief going on towards brompton the streets were quiet again
here i came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies i saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the fulham road they had been dead many days so that i hurried quickly past them the black powder covered them over and softened their outlines one or two had been disturbed by dogs
where there was no black powder it was curiously like a sunday in the city with the closed shops the houses locked up and the blinds drawn the desertion and the stillness in some places plunderers had been at work but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops a jewellers window had been broken open in one place but apparently the thief had been disturbed and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement i did not trouble to touch them farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement she seemed asleep but she was dead
the farther i penetrated into london the profounder grew the stillness but it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the stillness of suspense of expectation at any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis and had annihilated ealing and kilburn might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins it was a city condemned and derelict   
in south kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder it was near south kensington that i first heard the howling it crept almost imperceptibly upon my senses it was a sobbing alternation of two notes ulla ulla ulla ulla keeping on perpetually when i passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume and houses and buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again it came in a full tide down exhibition road i stopped staring towards kensington gardens wondering at this strange remote wailing it was as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude
ulla ulla ulla ulla wailed that superhuman note—great waves of sound sweeping down the broad sunlit roadway between the tall buildings on each side i turned northwards marvelling towards the iron gates of hyde park i had half a mind to break into the natural history museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers in order to see across the park but i decided to keep to the ground where quick hiding was possible and so went on up the exhibition road all the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses at the top near the park gate i came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned and the skeleton of a horse picked clean i puzzled over this for a time and then went on to the bridge over the serpentine the voice grew stronger and stronger though i could see nothing above the housetops on the north side of the park save a haze of smoke to the northwest
ulla ulla ulla ulla cried the voice coming as it seemed to me from the district about regents park the desolating cry worked upon my mind the mood that had sustained me passed the wailing took possession of me i found i was intensely weary footsore and now again hungry and thirsty
it was already past noon why was i wandering alone in this city of the dead? why was i alone when all london was lying in state and in its black shroud? i felt intolerably lonely my mind ran on old friends that i had forgotten for years i thought of the poisons in the chemists shops of the liquors the wine merchants stored; i recalled the two sodden creatures of despair who so far as i knew shared the city with myself   
i came into oxford street by the marble arch and here again were black powder and several bodies and an evil ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses i grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk with infinite trouble i managed to break into a public-house and get food and drink i was weary after eating and went into the parlour behind the bar and slept on a black horsehair sofa i found there
i awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears ulla ulla ulla ulla it was now dusk and after i had routed out some biscuits and a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe but it contained nothing but maggots—i wandered on through the silent residential squares to baker street—portman square is the only one i can name—and so came out at last upon regents park and as i emerged from the top of baker street i saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset the hood of the martian giant from which this howling proceeded i was not terrified i came upon him as if it were a matter of course i watched him for some time but he did not move he appeared to be standing and yelling for no reason that i could discover
i tried to formulate a plan of action that perpetual sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla confused my mind perhaps i was too tired to be very fearful certainly i was more curious to know the reason of this monotonous crying than afraid i turned back away from the park and struck into park road intending to skirt the park went along under the shelter of the terraces and got a view of this stationary howling martian from the direction of st johns wood a couple of hundred yards out of baker street i heard a yelping chorus and saw first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him he made a wide curve to avoid me as though he feared i might prove a fresh competitor as the yelping died away down the silent road the wailing sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla reasserted itself
i came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to st johns wood station at first i thought a house had fallen across the road it was only as i clambered among the ruins that i saw with a start this mechanical samson lying with its tentacles bent and smashed and twisted among the ruins it had made the forepart was shattered it seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house and had been overwhelmed in its overthrow it seemed to me then that this might have happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its martian i could not clamber among the ruins to see it and the twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was smeared and the gnawed gristle of the martian that the dogs had left were invisible to me
wondering still more at all that i had seen i pushed on towards primrose hill far away through a gap in the trees i saw a second martian as motionless as the first standing in the park towards the zoological gardens and silent a little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine i came upon the red weed again and found the regents canal a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation
as i crossed the bridge the sound of ulla ulla ulla ulla ceased it was as it were cut off the silence came like a thunderclap
the dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees towards the park were growing black all about me the red weed clambered among the ruins writhing to get above me in the dimness night the mother of fear and mystery was coming upon me but while that voice sounded the solitude the desolation had been endurable; by virtue of it london had still seemed alive and the sense of life about me had upheld me then suddenly a change the passing of something—i knew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt nothing but this gaunt quiet
london about me gazed at me spectrally the windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls about me my imagination found a thousand noiseless enemies moving terror seized me a horror of my temerity in front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred and i saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway i could not bring myself to go on i turned down st johns wood road and ran headlong from this unendurable stillness towards kilburn i hid from the night and the silence until long after midnight in a cabmens shelter in harrow road but before the dawn my courage returned and while the stars were still in the sky i turned once more towards regents park i missed my way among the streets and presently saw down a long avenue in the half-light of the early dawn the curve of primrose hill on the summit towering up to the fading stars was a third martian erect and motionless like the others
an insane resolve possessed me i would die and end it and i would save myself even the trouble of killing myself i marched on recklessly towards this titan and then as i drew nearer and the light grew i saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood at that my heart gave a bound and i began running along the road
i hurried through the red weed that choked st edmunds terrace (i waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from the waterworks towards the albert road) and emerged upon the grass before the rising of the sun great mounds had been heaped about the crest of the hill making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and largest place the martians had made—and from behind these heaps there rose a thin smoke against the sky against the sky line an eager dog ran and disappeared the thought that had flashed into my mind grew real grew credible i felt no fear only a wild trembling exultation as i ran up the hill towards the motionless monster out of the hood hung lank shreds of brown at which the hungry birds pecked and tore
in another moment i had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon its crest and the interior of the redoubt was below me a mighty space it was with gigantic machines here and there within it huge mounds of material and strange shelter places and scattered about it some in their overturned war-machines some in the now rigid handling-machines and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row were the martians—_dead_—slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain after all mans devices had failed by the humblest things that god in his wisdom has put upon this earth
for so it had come about as indeed i and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds these germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here but by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle and to many—those that cause putrefaction in dead matter for instance—our living frames are altogether immune but there are no bacteria in mars and directly these invaders arrived directly they drank and fed our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow already when i watched them they were irrevocably doomed dying and rotting even as they went to and fro it was inevitable by the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the martians ten times as mighty as they are for neither do men live nor die in vain
here and there they were scattered nearly fifty altogether in that great gulf they had made overtaken by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be to me also at that time this death was incomprehensible all i knew was that these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead for a moment i believed that the destruction of sennacherib had been repeated that god had repented that the angel of death had slain them in the night
i stood staring into the pit and my heart lightened gloriously even as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays the pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines so great and wonderful in their power and complexity so unearthly in their tortuous forms rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light a multitude of dogs i could hear fought over the bodies that lay darkly in the depth of the pit far below me across the pit on its farther lip flat and vast and strange lay the great flying-machine with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when decay and death arrested them death had come not a day too soon at the sound of a cawing overhead i looked up at the huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of primrose hill
i turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where enhaloed now in birds stood those other two martians that i had seen overnight just as death had overtaken them the one had died even as it had been crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die and its voice had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted they glittered now harmless tripod towers of shining metal in the brightness of the rising sun
all about the pit and saved as by a miracle from everlasting destruction stretched the great mother of cities those who have only seen london veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses
eastward over the blackened ruins of the albert terrace and the splintered spire of the church the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity
northward were kilburn and hampsted blue and crowded with houses; westward the great city was dimmed; and southward beyond the martians the green waves of regents park the langham hotel the dome of the albert hall the imperial institute and the giant mansions of the brompton road came out clear and little in the sunrise the jagged ruins of westminster rising hazily beyond far away and blue were the surrey hills and the towers of the crystal palace glittered like two silver rods the dome of st pauls was dark against the sunrise and injured i saw for the first time by a huge gaping cavity on its western side
and as i looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and churches silent and abandoned; as i thought of the multitudinous hopes and efforts the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this human reef and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung over it all; when i realised that the shadow had been rolled back and that men might still live in the streets and this dear vast dead city of mine be once more alive and powerful i felt a wave of emotion that was near akin to tears
the torment was over even that day the healing would begin the survivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless lawless foodless like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by sea would begin to return; the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the vacant squares whatever destruction was done the hand of the destroyer was stayed all the gaunt wrecks the blackened skeletons of houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill would presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with the tapping of their trowels at the thought i extended my hands towards the sky and began thanking god in a year thought i—in a year   
with overwhelming force came the thought of myself of my wife and the old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever
ix wreckage and now comes the strangest thing in my story yet perhaps it is not altogether strange i remember clearly and coldly and vividly all that i did that day until the time that i stood weeping and praising god upon the summit of primrose hill and then i forget
of the next three days i know nothing i have learned since that so far from my being the first discoverer of the martian overthrow several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night one man—the first—had gone to st martins-le-grand and while i sheltered in the cabmens hut had contrived to telegraph to paris thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a thousand cities chilled by ghastly apprehensions suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in dublin edinburgh manchester birmingham at the time when i stood upon the verge of the pit already men weeping with joy as i have heard shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout were making up trains even as near as crewe to descend upon london the church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news until all england was bell-ringing men on cycles lean-faced unkempt scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance shouting to gaunt staring figures of despair and for the food across the channel across the irish sea across the atlantic corn bread and meat were tearing to our relief all the shipping in the world seemed going londonward in those days but of all this i have no memory i drifted—a demented man i found myself in a house of kindly people who had found me on the third day wandering weeping and raving through the streets of st johns wood they have told me since that i was singing some insane doggerel about the last man left alive hurrah the last man left alive troubled as they were with their own affairs these people whose name much as i would like to express my gratitude to them i may not even give here nevertheless cumbered themselves with me sheltered me and protected me from myself apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse
very gently when my mind was assured again did they break to me what they had learned of the fate of leatherhead two days after i was imprisoned it had been destroyed with every soul in it by a martian he had swept it out of existence as it seemed without any provocation as a boy might crush an ant hill in the mere wantonness of power
i was a lonely man and they were very kind to me i was a lonely man and a sad one and they bore with me i remained with them four days after my recovery all that time i felt a vague a growing craving to look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so happy and bright in my past it was a mere hopeless desire to feast upon my misery they dissuaded me they did all they could to divert me from this morbidity but at last i could resist the impulse no longer and promising faithfully to return to them and parting as i will confess from these four-day friends with tears i went out again into the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty
already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were shops open and i saw a drinking fountain running water
i remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as i went back on my melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at woking how busy the streets and vivid the moving life about me so many people were abroad everywhere busied in a thousand activities that it seemed incredible that any great proportion of the population could have been slain but then i noticed how yellow were the skins of the people i met how shaggy the hair of the men how large and bright their eyes and that every other man still wore his dirty rags their faces seemed all with one of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim resolution save for the expression of the faces london seemed a city of tramps the vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent us by the french government the ribs of the few horses showed dismally haggard special constables with white badges stood at the corners of every street i saw little of the mischief wrought by the martians until i reached wellington street and there i saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of waterloo bridge
at the corner of the bridge too i saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed transfixed by a stick that kept it in place it was the placard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _daily mail_ i bought a copy for a blackened shilling i found in my pocket most of it was in blank but the solitary compositor who did the thing had amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on the back page the matter he printed was emotional; the news organisation had not as yet found its way back i learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the examination of the martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results among other things the article assured me what i did not believe at the time that the secret of flying was discovered at waterloo i found the free trains that were taking people to their homes the first rush was already over there were few people in the train and i was in no mood for casual conversation i got a compartment to myself and sat with folded arms looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows and just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins to clapham junction the face of london was grimy with powder of the black smoke in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain and at clapham junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary navvies and we were jolted over a hasty relaying
all down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and unfamiliar; wimbledon particularly had suffered walton by virtue of its unburned pine woods seemed the least hurt of any place along the line the wandle the mole every little stream was a heaped mass of red weed in appearance between butchers meat and pickled cabbage the surrey pine woods were too dry however for the festoons of the red climber beyond wimbledon within sight of the line in certain nursery grounds were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder a number of people were standing about it and some sappers were busy in the midst of it over it flaunted a union jack flapping cheerfully in the morning breeze the nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows and very painful to the eye ones gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills
the line on the london side of woking station was still undergoing repair so i descended at byfleet station and took the road to maybury past the place where i and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars and on by the spot where the martian had appeared to me in the thunderstorm here moved by curiosity i turned aside to find among a tangle of red fronds the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed for a time i stood regarding these vestiges   
then i returned through the pine wood neck-high with red weed here and there to find the landlord of the spotted dog had already found burial and so came home past the college arms a man standing at an open cottage door greeted me by name as i passed
i looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately the door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as i approached
it slammed again the curtains of my study fluttered out of the open window from which i and the artilleryman had watched the dawn no one had closed it since the smashed bushes were just as i had left them nearly four weeks ago i stumbled into the hall and the house felt empty the stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where i had crouched soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the catastrophe our muddy footsteps i saw still went up the stairs
i followed them to my study and found lying on my writing-table still with the selenite paper weight upon it the sheet of work i had left on the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder for a space i stood reading over my abandoned arguments it was a paper on the probable development of moral ideas with the development of the civilising process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: in about two hundred years i had written we may expect—— the sentence ended abruptly i remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning scarcely a month gone by and how i had broken off to get my _daily chronicle_ from the newsboy i remembered how i went down to the garden gate as he came along and how i had listened to his odd story of men from mars
i came down and went into the dining room there were the mutton and the bread both far gone now in decay and a beer bottle overturned just as i and the artilleryman had left them my home was desolate i perceived the folly of the faint hope i had cherished so long and then a strange thing occurred it is no use said a voice the house is deserted no one has been here these ten days do not stay here to torment yourself no one escaped but you
i was startled had i spoken my thought aloud? i turned and the french window was open behind me i made a step to it and stood looking out
and there amazed and afraid even as i stood amazed and afraid were my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless she gave a faint cry
i came she said i knew—knew——
she put her hand to her throat—swayed i made a step forward and caught her in my arms
x the epilogue i cannot but regret now that i am concluding my story how little i am able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions which are still unsettled in one respect i shall certainly provoke criticism my particular province is speculative philosophy my knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two but it seems to me that carvers suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a proven conclusion i have assumed that in the body of my narrative
at any rate in all the bodies of the martians that were examined after the war no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were found that they did not bury any of their dead and the reckless slaughter they perpetrated point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive process but probable as this seems it is by no means a proven conclusion
neither is the composition of the black smoke known which the martians used with such deadly effect and the generator of the heat-rays remains a puzzle the terrible disasters at the ealing and south kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the latter spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood but such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader to whom this story is addressed none of the brown scum that drifted down the thames after the destruction of shepperton was examined at the time and now none is forthcoming
the results of an anatomical examination of the martians so far as the prowling dogs had left such an examination possible i have already given but everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete specimen in spirits at the natural history museum and the countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific
a question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of another attack from the martians i do not think that nearly enough attention is being given to this aspect of the matter at present the planet mars is in conjunction but with every return to opposition i for one anticipate a renewal of their adventure in any case we should be prepared it seems to me that it should be possible to define the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the planet and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack
in that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery before it was sufficiently cool for the martians to emerge or they might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened it seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of their first surprise possibly they see it in the same light
lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the martians have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet venus seven months ago now venus and mars were in alignment with the sun; that is to say mars was in opposition from the point of view of an observer on venus subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet and almost simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a photograph of the martian disk one needs to see the drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character
at any rate whether we expect another invasion or not our views of the human future must be greatly modified by these events we have learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for man; we can never anticipate the unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space it may be that in the larger design of the universe this invasion from mars is not without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of decadence the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous and it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of mankind it may be that across the immensity of space the martians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson and that on the planet venus they have found a securer settlement be that as it may for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the martian disk and those fiery darts of the sky the shooting stars will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men
the broadening of mens views that has resulted can scarcely be exaggerated before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our minute sphere now we see further if the martians can reach venus there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable as at last it must do it may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet within its toils
dim and wonderful is the vision i have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space but that is a remote dream it may be on the other hand that the destruction of the martians is only a reprieve to them and not to us perhaps is the future ordained
i must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind i sit in my study writing by lamplight and suddenly i see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate i go out into the byfleet road and vehicles pass me a butcher boy in a cart a cabful of visitors a workman on a bicycle children going to school and suddenly they become vague and unreal and i hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot brooding silence of a night i see the black powder darkening the silent streets and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten they gibber and grow fiercer paler uglier mad distortions of humanity at last and i wake cold and wretched in the darkness of the night
i go to london and see the busy multitudes in fleet street and the strand and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past haunting the streets that i have seen silent and wretched going to and fro phantasms in a dead city the mockery of life in a galvanised body and strange too it is to stand on primrose hill as i did but a day before writing this last chapter to see the great province of houses dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist vanishing at last into the vague lower sky to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill to see the sight-seers about the martian machine that stands there still to hear the tumult of playing children and to recall the time when i saw it all bright and clear-cut hard and silent under the dawn of that last great day   
and strangest of all is it to hold my wifes hand again and to think that i have counted her and that she has counted me among the dead
letter 1 _to mrs saville england_
st petersburgh dec 11th 17— you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking
i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight do you understand this feeling? this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour there—for with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes what may not be expected in a country of eternal light? i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine
these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas library my education was neglected yet i was passionately fond of reading these volumes were my study day and night and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt as a child on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life
these visions faded when i perused for the first time those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent
six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking i can even now remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise i commenced by inuring my body to hardship i accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea; i voluntarily endured cold famine thirst and want of sleep; i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage twice i actually hired myself as an under-mate in a greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness so valuable did he consider my services
and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? my life might have been passed in ease and luxury but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path oh that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate and my spirits are often depressed i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: i am required not only to raise the spirits of others but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs are failing
this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach the cold is not excessive if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which i have already adopted for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins i have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between st petersburgh and archangel
i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing i do not intend to sail until the month of june; and when shall i return? ah dear sister how can i answer this question? if i succeed many many months perhaps years will pass before you and i may meet if i fail you will see me again soon or never
farewell my dear excellent margaret heaven shower down blessings on you and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness
your affectionate brother r walton letter 2
_to mrs saville england_ archangel 28th march 17—
how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage
but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have no friend margaret: when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success there will be none to participate my joy; if i am assailed by disappointment no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thoughts to paper it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me whose eyes would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind whose tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties but it is a still greater evil to me that i am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country now i am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want (as the painters call it) _keeping;_ and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind
well these are useless complaints; i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in these rugged bosoms my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his profession he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise
the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations what a noble fellow you will exclaim he is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his conduct the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command
yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know that i am wavering in my resolutions those are as fixed as fate and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation the winter has been dreadfully severe but the spring promises well and it is considered as a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected i shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care
i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with which i am preparing to depart i am going to unexplored regions to the land of mist and snow but i shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ancient mariner you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret i have often attributed my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand i am practically industrious—painstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwined in all my projects which hurries me out of the common pathways of men even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore
but to return to dearer considerations shall i meet you again after having traversed immense seas and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america? i dare not expect such success yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits i love you very tenderly remember me with affection should you never hear from me again
your affectionate brother robert walton letter 3
_to mrs saville england_ july 7th 17—
my dear sister i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe—and well advanced on my voyage this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel; more fortunate than i who may not see my native land perhaps for many years i am however in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing appear to dismay them we have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer and although not so warm as in england the southern gales which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected
no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage
adieu my dear margaret be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger i will be cool persevering and prudent
but success _shall_ crown my endeavours wherefore not? thus far i have gone tracing a secure way over the pathless seas the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?
my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus but i must finish heaven bless my beloved sister
rw letter 4 _to mrs saville england_
august 5th 17— so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession
last monday (july 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice which closed in the ship on all sides scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated our situation was somewhat dangerous especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog we accordingly lay to hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather
about two oclock the mist cleared away and we beheld stretched out in every direction vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end some of my comrades groaned and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation we perceived a low carriage fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass on towards the north at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man but apparently of gigantic stature sat in the sledge and guided the dogs we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice
this appearance excited our unqualified wonder we were as we believed many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not in reality so distant as we had supposed shut in however by ice it was impossible to follow his track which we had observed with the greatest attention
about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea and before night the ice broke and freed our ship we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice i profited of this time to rest for a few hours
in the morning however as soon as it was light i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel apparently talking to someone in the sea it was in fact a sledge like that we had seen before which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel he was not as the other traveller seemed to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european when i appeared on deck the master said here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea
on perceiving me the stranger addressed me in english although with a foreign accent before i come on board your vessel said he will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?
you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford i replied however that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole
upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board good god margaret if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety your surprise would have been boundless his limbs were nearly frozen and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering i never saw a man in so wretched a condition we attempted to carry him into the cabin but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully
two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding when he had in some measure recovered i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit i never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled but he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him
when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle
his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom and he replied to seek one who fled from me
and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?
yes then i fancy we have seen him for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge with a man in it across the ice
this aroused the strangers attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dæmon as he called him had pursued soon after when he was alone with me he said i have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries
certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine
and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life
soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this i could not judge
from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight
such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him although they have had very little communication with him for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion he must have been a noble creature in his better days being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable
i said in one of my letters my dear margaret that i should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet i have found a man who before his spirit had been broken by misery i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart
i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals should i have any fresh incidents to record
august 13th 17— my affection for my guest increases every day he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? he is so gentle yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence
he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others he has frequently conversed with me on mine which i have communicated to him without disguise he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise one mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race as i spoke a dark gloom spread over my listeners countenance at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast i paused; at length he spoke in broken accents: unhappy man do you share my madness? have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? hear me; let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips
such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure
having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally he asked me the history of my earlier years the tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection i spoke of my desire of finding a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing
i agree with you replied the stranger; we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures i once had a friend the most noble of human creatures and am entitled therefore to judge respecting friendship you have hope and the world before you and have no cause for despair but i—i have lost everything and cannot begin life anew
as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief that touched me to the heart but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin
even broken in spirit as he is no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature the starry sky the sea and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments yet when he has retired into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly ventures
will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer? you would not if you saw him you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew i believe it to be an intuitive discernment a quick but never-failing power of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music
august 19th 17— yesterday the stranger said to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did; and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed
you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power i expressed these feelings in my answer
i thank you he replied for your sympathy but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled i wait but for one event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him; but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined
he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this promise drew from me the warmest thanks i have resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties to record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related during the day if i should be engaged i will at least make notes this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus
chapter 1 i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family
as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance
beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode overjoyed at this discovery he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchants house the interval was consequently spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion
his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity she procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life
several months passed in this manner her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beauforts coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation two years after this event caroline became his wife
there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection there was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame
from italy they visited germany and france i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles i remained for several years their only child much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me my mothers tender caresses and my fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections i was their plaything and their idol and something better—their child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of self-control i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me
for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty; it was a necessity a passion—remembering what she had suffered and how she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were dark-eyed hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heaven-sent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features
the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi_ who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country he became the victim of its weakness whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known his property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles
when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills the apparition was soon explained with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her they were fond of the sweet orphan her presence had seemed a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures
everyone loved elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully i have a pretty present for my victor—tomorrow he shall have it and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine—mine to protect love and cherish all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister since till death she was to be mine only
chapter 2 we were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home —the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember
on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country we possessed a house in geneva and a _campagne_ on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i was indifferent therefore to my school-fellows in general; but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva he was a boy of singular talent and fancy he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels
no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love
my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world
meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy was ours; her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness and clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval? yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition
i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self besides in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events which led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys
natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa i opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicated my discovery to my father my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash
if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical while those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity
when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit
the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses the most learned philosopher knew little more he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomise and give names; but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined
but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva i was to a great degree self-taught with regard to my favourite studies my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with a childs blindness added to a students thirst for knowledge under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention wealth was an inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death
nor were these my only visions the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas
when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens i remained while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothing remained but a blasted stump when we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed
before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration
thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard
it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectual destiny was too potent and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction
chapter 3 when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurred—an omen as it were of my future misery
elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe and she was in the greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper—elizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver on the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union this expectation will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my younger children alas i regret that i am taken from you; and happy and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all? but these are not thoughts befitting me; i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world
she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more to be heard these are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel? the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished my mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized
my departure for ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to death of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me and above all i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled
she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins never was she so enchanting as at this time when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget
the day of my departure at length arrived clerval spent the last evening with us he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain his father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education he said little but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce
we sat late we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word farewell it was said and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at mornings dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away they were all there—my father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend
i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—i was now alone in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances i loved my brothers elizabeth and clerval; these were old familiar faces but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers such were my reflections as i commenced my journey; but as i proceeded my spirits and hopes rose i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge i had often when at home thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings now my desires were complied with and it would indeed have been folly to repent
i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased
the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors chance—or rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my fathers door—led me first to m krempe professor of natural philosophy he was an uncouth man but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy i replied carelessly and partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied the professor stared have you he said really spent your time in studying such nonsense?
i replied in the affirmative every minute continued m krempe with warmth every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names good god in what desert land have you lived where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient? i little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew
so saying he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations and that m waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted
i returned home not disappointed for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape m krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher therefore did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain perhaps i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists besides i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views although futile were grand; but now the scene was changed the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth
such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode but as the ensuing week commenced i thought of the information which m krempe had given me concerning the lectures and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit i recollected what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town
partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i went into the lecturing room which m waldman entered shortly after this professor was very unlike his colleague he appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms after having made a few preparatory experiments he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which i shall never forget:
the ancient teachers of this science said he promised impossibilities and performed nothing the modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places they ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows
such were the professors words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded and soon my mind was filled with one thought one conception one purpose so much has been done exclaimed the soul of frankenstein—more far more will i achieve; treading in the steps already marked i will pioneer a new way explore unknown powers and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation
i closed not my eyes that night my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; i felt that order would thence arise but i had no power to produce it by degrees after the mornings dawn sleep came i awoke and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m krempe had exhibited he said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge they had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind i listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; i expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape (inexperience in life would have made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure
i am happy said m waldman to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability i have no doubt of your success chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time i have not neglected the other branches of science a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy including mathematics
he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism he also gave me the list of books which i had requested and i took my leave
thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny
chapter 4 from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the term became nearly my sole occupation i read with ardour those works so full of genius and discrimination which modern inquirers have written on these subjects i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i found even in m krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information combined it is true with a repulsive physiognomy and manners but not on that account the less valuable in m waldman i found a true friend his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory
as i applied so closely it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students and my proficiency that of the masters professor krempe often asked me with a sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress two years passed in this manner during which i paid no visit to geneva but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and i who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements i thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay
one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed? it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient; i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret
remember i am not recording the vision of a madman the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true some miracle might have produced it yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay more i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter
the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated and i beheld only the result what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once: the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light
i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express my friend that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject i will not lead you on unguarded and ardent as i then was to your destruction and infallible misery learn from me if not by my precepts at least by my example how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow
when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles and veins still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled and at last my work be imperfect yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved contrary to my first intention to make the being of a gigantic stature that is to say about eight feet in height and proportionably large after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began
no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success life and death appeared to me ideal bounds which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs pursuing these reflections i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time (although i now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption
these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed; yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hiding-places who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits i collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion
the summer months passed while i was thus engaged heart and soul in one pursuit it was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom i had not seen for so long a time i knew my silence disquieted them and i well remembered the words of my father: i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection and we shall hear regularly from you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected
i knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination i wished as it were to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object which swallowed up every habit of my nature should be completed
i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind if this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections greece had not been enslaved cæsar would have spared his country america would have been discovered more gradually and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed
but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale and your looks remind me to proceed
my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before winter spring and summer passed away during my labours; but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was i engrossed in my occupation the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment every night i was oppressed by a slow fever and i became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete
chapter 5 it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony i collected the instruments of life around me that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet it was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes and my candle was nearly burnt out when by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs
how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form? his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips
the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body for this i had deprived myself of rest and health i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness but it was in vain; i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel i started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed; when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom i had created he held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear; one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life
oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch i had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived
i passed the night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery; at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness mingled with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid the overthrow so complete
morning dismal and wet at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt its white steeple and clock which indicated the sixth hour the porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issued into the streets pacing them with quick steps as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky
i continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear and i hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me: like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head; because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread [coleridges ancient mariner]
continuing thus i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped here i paused i knew not why; but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence; it stopped just where i was standing and on the door being opened i perceived henry clerval who on seeing me instantly sprung out my dear frankenstein exclaimed he how glad i am to see you how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting
nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father elizabeth and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection i grasped his hand and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; i felt suddenly and for the first time during many months calm and serene joy i welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordial manner and we walked towards my college clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt you may easily believe said he how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and indeed i believe i left him incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield: i have ten thousand florins a year without greek i eat heartily without greek but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge
it gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father brothers and elizabeth
very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom by the by i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein continued he stopping short and gazing full in my face i did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights
you have guessed right; i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest as you see; but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free
i trembled excessively; i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night i walked with a quick pace and we soon arrived at my college i then reflected and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there alive and walking about i dreaded to behold this monster but i feared still more that henry should see him entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs i darted up towards my own room my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself i then paused and a cold shivering came over me i threw the door forcibly open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared i stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval
we ascended into my room and the servant presently brought breakfast; but i was unable to contain myself it was not joy only that possessed me; i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; i jumped over the chairs clapped my hands and laughed aloud clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival but when he observed me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him
my dear victor cried he what for gods sake is the matter? do not laugh in that manner how ill you are what is the cause of all this?
do not ask me cried i putting my hands before my eyes for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; _he_ can tell oh save me save me i imagined that the monster seized me; i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit
poor clerval what must have been his feelings? a meeting which he anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness but i was not the witness of his grief for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long long time
this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months during all that time henry was my only nurse i afterwards learned that knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them
but i was in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes and i raved incessantly concerning him doubtless my words surprised henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event
by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend i recovered i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window it was a divine spring and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion
dearest clerval exclaimed i how kind how very good you are to me this whole winter instead of being spent in study as you promised yourself has been consumed in my sick room how shall i ever repay you? i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion but you will forgive me
you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits i may speak to you on one subject may i not?
i trembled one subject what could it be? could he allude to an object on whom i dared not even think?
compose yourself said clerval who observed my change of colour i will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence
is that all my dear henry? how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love?
if this is your present temper my friend you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin i believe
chapter 6 clerval then put the following letter into my hands it was from my own elizabeth:
my dearest cousin you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account you are forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you dear victor is necessary to calm our apprehensions for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin yet that is over now: clerval writes that indeed you are getting better i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting
get well—and return to us you will find a happy cheerful home and friends who love you dearly your fathers health is vigorous and he asks but to see you but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service but we cannot part with him at least until his elder brother returns to us my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never had your powers of application he looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected
little alteration except the growth of our dear children has taken place since you left us the blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change; and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy kind faces around me since you left us but one change has taken place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family? probably you do not; i will relate her history therefore in a few words madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m moritz treated her very ill my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england justine thus received in our family learned the duties of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being
justine you may remember was a great favourite of yours; and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and happy my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended this benefit was fully repaid; justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her
when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her
one by one her brothers and sister died; and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless the conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she was a roman catholic; and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother poor girl she wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine has just returned to us; and i assure you i love her tenderly she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty; as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt
i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health he has already had one or two little _wives_ but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age
now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon married m duvillard the rich banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she is a widow and much older than manoir; but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody
i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude write dearest victor—one line—one word will be a blessing to us ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness his affection and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful adieu my cousin; take care of yourself; and i entreat you write
elizabeth lavenza geneva march 18th 17—
dear dear elizabeth i exclaimed when i had read her letter: i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel i wrote and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber
one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors m waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences he soon perceived that i disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out what could i do? he meant to please and he tormented me i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply
m krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m waldman d—n the fellow cried he; why m clerval i assure you he has outstript us all ay stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true a youngster who but a few years ago believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down we shall all be out of countenance—ay ay continued he observing my face expressive of suffering m frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man young men should be diffident of themselves you know m clerval: i was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time
m krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me
clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses—in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome
summer passed away in these occupations and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents winter and snow arrived the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring i felt this delay very bitterly; for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants the winter however was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness
the month of may had already commenced and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited i acceded with pleasure to this proposition: i was fond of exercise and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country
we passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed the natural incidents of our progress and the conversation of my friend study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures and rendered me unsocial; but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; i became the same happy creature who a few years ago loved and beloved by all had no sorrow or care when happy inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy the present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off with an invincible burden
henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often in imitation of the persian and arabic writers he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion at other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity
we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing and every one we met appeared gay and happy my own spirits were high and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity
chapter 7 on my return i found the following letter from my father:—
my dear victor you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you but that would be a cruel kindness and i dare not do it what would be your surprise my son when you expected a happy and glad welcome to behold on the contrary tears and wretchedness? and how victor can i relate our misfortune? absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son? i wish to prepare you for the woeful news but i know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings
william is dead—that sweet child whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart who was so gentle yet so gay victor he is murdered
i will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction
last thursday (may 7th) i my niece and your two brothers went to walk in plainpalais the evening was warm and serene and we prolonged our walk farther than usual it was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that william and ernest who had gone on before were not to be found we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return presently ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said that he had been playing with him that william had run away to hide himself and that he vainly sought for him and afterwards waited for a long time but that he did not return
this account rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him until night fell when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house he was not there we returned again with torches; for i could not rest when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murders finger was on his neck
he was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth she was very earnest to see the corpse at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed o god i have murdered my darling child
she fainted and was restored with extreme difficulty when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh she told me that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother this picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed we have no trace of him at present although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved william
come dearest victor; you alone can console elizabeth she weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart we are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you my son to return and be our comforter? your dear mother alas victor i now say thank god she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling
come victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wounds of our minds enter the house of mourning my friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you and not with hatred for your enemies
your affectionate and afflicted father alphonse frankenstein
geneva may 12th 17— clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving new from my friends i threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands
my dear frankenstein exclaimed henry when he perceived me weep with bitterness are you always to be unhappy? my dear friend what has happened?
i motioned him to take up the letter while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval as he read the account of my misfortune
i can offer you no consolation my friend said he; your disaster is irreparable what do you intend to do?
to go instantly to geneva: come with me henry to order the horses
during our walk clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy poor william said he dear lovely child he now sleeps with his angel mother who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so miserably; to feel the murderers grasp how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence poor little fellow one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep but he is at rest the pang is over his sufferings are at an end for ever a sod covers his gentle form and he knows no pain he can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors
clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude but now as soon as the horses arrived i hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend
my journey was very melancholy at first i wished to hurry on for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when i drew near my native town i slackened my progress i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind i passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which i had not seen for nearly six years how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which although they were done more tranquilly might not be the less decisive fear overcame me; i dared no advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble although i was unable to define them
i remained two days at lausanne in this painful state of mind i contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains the palaces of nature were not changed by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me and i continued my journey towards geneva
the road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as i approached my native town i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc i wept like a child dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer? your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness?
i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure my country my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake
yet as i drew nearer home grief and fear again overcame me night also closed around; and when i could hardly see the dark mountains i felt still more gloomily the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings alas i prophesied truly and failed only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure
it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the city the sky was serene; and as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered as i could not pass through the town i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures the storm appeared to approach rapidly and on landing i ascended a low hill that i might observe its progress it advanced; the heavens were clouded and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly increased
i quitted my seat and walked on although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head it was echoed from salêve the juras and the alps of savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash the storm as is often the case in switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of copêt another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the môle a peaked mountain to the east of the lake
while i watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wandered on with a hasty step this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; i clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud william dear angel this is thy funeral this thy dirge as i said these words i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; i stood fixed gazing intently: i could not be mistaken a flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly informed me that it was the wretch the filthy dæmon to whom i had given life what did he there? could he be (i shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? no sooner did that idea cross my imagination than i became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered and i was forced to lean against a tree for support the figure passed me quickly and i lost it in the gloom nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child _he_ was the murderer i could not doubt it the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact i thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont salêve a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south he soon reached the summit and disappeared
i remained motionless the thunder ceased; but the rain still continued and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? alas i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?
no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night which i spent cold and wet in the open air but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror such as the deed which he had now done nearly in the light of my own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me
day dawned; and i directed my steps towards the town the gates were open and i hastened to my fathers house my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell a being whom i myself had formed and endued with life had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity besides the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it and then of what use would be pursuit? who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont salêve? these reflections determined me and i resolved to remain silent
it was about five in the morning when i entered my fathers house i told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising
six years had elapsed passed in a dream but for one indelible trace and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt beloved and venerable parent he still remained to me i gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantel-piece it was an historical subject painted at my fathers desire and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead father her garb was rustic and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity below this picture was a miniature of william; and my tears flowed when i looked upon it while i was thus engaged ernest entered: he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me: welcome my dearest victor said he ah i wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations—poor william he was our darling and our pride
tears unrestrained fell from my brothers eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame before i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster i tried to calm ernest; i enquired more minutely concerning my father and here i named my cousin
she most of all said ernest requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother and that made her very wretched but since the murderer has been discovered—
the murderer discovered good god how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? it is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountain-stream with a straw i saw him too; he was free last night
i do not know what you mean replied my brother in accents of wonder but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery no one would believe it at first; and even now elizabeth will not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence indeed who would credit that justine moritz who was so amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appalling a crime?
justine moritz poor poor girl is she the accused? but it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it surely ernest?
no one did at first; but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt but she will be tried today and you will then hear all
he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer the servant instantly showed it to one of the others who without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate; and upon their deposition justine was apprehended on being charged with the fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner
this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith; and i replied earnestly you are all mistaken; i know the murderer justine poor good justine is innocent
at that instant my father entered i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster had not ernest exclaimed good god papa victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william
we do also unfortunately replied my father for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly
my dear father you are mistaken; justine is innocent
if she is god forbid that she should suffer as guilty she is to be tried today and i hope i sincerely hope that she will be acquitted
this speech calmed me i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder i had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her my tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar did any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world?
we were soon joined by elizabeth time had altered her since i last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years there was the same candour the same vivacity but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect she welcomed me with the greatest affection your arrival my dear cousin said she fills me with hope you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine alas who is safe if she be convicted of crime? i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love is to be torn away by even a worse fate if she is condemned i never shall know joy more but she will not i am sure she will not; and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william
she is innocent my elizabeth said i and that shall be proved; fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal
how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt and that made me wretched for i knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing she wept
dearest niece said my father dry your tears if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our laws and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality
chapter 8 we passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock when the trial was to commence my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses i accompanied them to the court during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me
the appearance of justine was calm she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed she was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness
the trial began and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer she returned to the house about eight oclock and when one inquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him when shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court
justine was called on for her defence as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice
god knows she said how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious
she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chêne a village situated at about a league from geneva on her return at about nine oclock she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of geneva were shut and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her and she awoke it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concerning the picture she could give no account
i know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it; and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket but here also i am checked i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly did the murderer place it there? i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or if i had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon?
i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence
several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court
i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character i am well acquainted with the accused i have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nearly two years during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncles house where she was beloved by all the family she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her
a murmur of approbation followed elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial i believed in her innocence; i knew it could the dæmon who had (i did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? i could not sustain the horror of my situation and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out of the court in agony the tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold
i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness in the morning i went to the court; my lips and throat were parched i dared not ask the fatal question but i was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit the ballots had been thrown; they were all black and justine was condemned
i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt i had before experienced sensations of horror and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that i then endured the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt that evidence he observed was hardly required in so glaring a case but i am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive
this was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? had my eyes deceived me? and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions? i hastened to return home and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result
my cousin replied i it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape but she has confessed
this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness upon justines innocence alas said she how shall i ever again believe in human goodness? justine whom i loved and esteemed as my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she has committed a murder
soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilty; and you victor shall accompany me; i cannot go alone the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse
we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled and her head rested on her knees she rose on seeing us enter and when we were left alone with her she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth weeping bitterly my cousin wept also
oh justine said she why did you rob me of my last consolation? i relied on your innocence and although i was then very wretched i was not so miserable as i am now
and do you also believe that i am so very very wicked? do you also join with my enemies to crush me to condemn me as a murderer? her voice was suffocated with sobs
rise my poor girl said elizabeth; why do you kneel if you are innocent? i am not one of your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt that report you say is false; and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession
i did confess but i confessed a lie i confessed that i might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins the god of heaven forgive me ever since i was condemned my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate dear lady i had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition what could i do? in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie; and now only am i truly miserable
she paused weeping and then continued i thought with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me going as i am to suffer ignominy and death
oh justine forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you why did you confess? but do not mourn dear girl do not fear i will proclaim i will prove your innocence i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune
justine shook her head mournfully i do not fear to die she said; that pang is past god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst i leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven
during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me despair who dared talk of that? the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul justine started when she saw who it was she approached me and said dear sir you are very kind to visit me; you i hope do not believe that i am guilty?
i could not answer no justine said elizabeth; he is more convinced of your innocence than i was for even when he heard that you had confessed he did not credit it
i truly thank him in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you dear lady and your cousin
thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself she indeed gained the resignation she desired but i the true murderer felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom which allowed of no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away i wish cried she that i were to die with you; i cannot live in this world of misery
justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend; may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so
and on the morrow justine died elizabeths heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men my purposed avowal died away on my lips thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim she perished on the scaffold as a murderess
from the tortures of my own heart i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth this also was my doing and my fathers woe and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands ye weep unhappy ones but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein your son your kinsman your early much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you—he bids you weep to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes if thus inexorable fate be satisfied and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments
thus spoke my prophetic soul as torn by remorse horror and despair i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts
chapter 9 nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear justine died she rested and i was alive the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove sleep fled from my eyes; i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more (i persuaded myself) was yet behind yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe
this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained i shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation—deep dark deathlike solitude
my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me do you think victor said he that i do not suffer also? no one could love a child more than i loved your brother—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? it is also a duty owed to yourself for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment or even the discharge of daily usefulness without which no man is fit for society
this advice although good was totally inapplicable to my case; i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness and terror its alarm with my other sensations now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view
about this time we retired to our house at belrive this change was particularly agreeable to me the shutting of the gates regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me i was now free often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind; and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly—if i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore—often i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviving brother; should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them?
at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness but that could not be remorse extinguished every hope i had been the author of unalterable evils and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes could i when there have precipitated him to their base i wished to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine
our house was the house of mourning my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles
when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood yet i am certainly unjust everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness? i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch
i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said my dearest friend you must calm yourself these events have affected me god knows how deeply; but i am not so wretched as you are there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble dear victor banish these dark passions remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you have we lost the power of rendering you happy? ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace?
and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart? even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her
thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it and to die was but a type of me
sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my intolerable sensations it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys sought in the magnificence the eternity of such scenes to forget myself and my ephemeral because human sorrows my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix i had visited it frequently during my boyhood six years had passed since then: _i_ was a wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes
i performed the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hired a mule as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads the weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotence—and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific guise still as i ascended higher the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains the impetuous arve and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all as belonging to another earth the habitations of another race of beings
i passed the bridge of pélissier where the ravine which the river forms opened before me and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it soon after i entered the valley of chamounix this valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox through which i had just passed the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields immense glaciers approached the road; i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_ and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley
a tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey some turn in the road some new object suddenly perceived and recognised reminded me of days gone by and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood the very winds whispered in soothing accents and maternal nature bade me weep no more then again the kindly influence ceased to act—i found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection then i spurred on my animal striving so to forget the world my fears and more than all myself—or in a more desperate fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair
at length i arrived at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me; i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion
chapter 10 i spent the following day roaming through the valley i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month i retired to rest at night; my slumbers as it were waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day they congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top the glittering pinnacle the pine woods and ragged bare ravine the eagle soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace
where had they fled when the next morning i awoke? all of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep and dark melancholy clouded every thought the rain was pouring in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats what were rain and storm to me? my mule was brought to the door and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life i determined to go without a guide for i was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene
the ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain it is a scene terrifically desolate in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees the path as you ascend higher is intersected by ravines of snow down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as even speaking in a loud voice produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker the pines are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene i looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings if our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us
we rest; a dream has power to poison sleep we rise; one wandring thought pollutes the day we feel conceive or reason; laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our cares away; it is the same: for be it joy or sorrow the path of its departure still is free mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow; nought may endure but mutability
it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league; and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds my heart which was before sorrowful now swelled with something like joy; i exclaimed wandering spirits if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life
as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed he bounded over the crevices in the ice among which i had walked with caution; his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man i was troubled; a mist came over my eyes and i felt a faintness seize me but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains i perceived as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred) that it was the wretch whom i had created i trembled with rage and horror resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat he approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignity while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes but i scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt
devil i exclaimed do you dare approach me? and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust and oh that i could with the extinction of your miserable existence restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered
i expected this reception said the dæmon all men hate the wretched; how then must i be hated who am miserable beyond all living things yet you my creator detest and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us you purpose to kill me how dare you sport thus with life? do your duty towards me and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind if you will comply with my conditions i will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse i will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends
abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes wretched devil you reproach me with your creation come on then that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed
my rage was without bounds; i sprang on him impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another
he easily eluded me and said
be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head have i not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery? life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it remember thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine my joints more supple but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee i am thy creature and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part the which thou owest me oh frankenstein be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone to whom thy justice and even thy clemency and affection is most due remember that i am thy creature; i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed everywhere i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded i was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend make me happy and i shall again be virtuous
begone i will not hear you there can be no community between you and me; we are enemies begone or let us try our strength in a fight in which one must fall
how can i move thee? will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature who implores thy goodness and compassion? believe me frankenstein i was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am i not alone miserably alone? you my creator abhor me; what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures who owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge i have wandered here many days; the caves of ice which i only do not fear are a dwelling to me and the only one which man does not grudge these bleak skies i hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction shall i not then hate them who abhor me? i will keep no terms with my enemies i am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness yet it is in your power to recompense me and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me listen to my tale; when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve but hear me the guilty are allowed by human laws bloody as they are to speak in their own defence before they are condemned listen to me frankenstein you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature oh praise the eternal justice of man yet i ask you not to spare me; listen to me and then if you can and if you will destroy the work of your hands
why do you call to my remembrance i rejoined circumstances of which i shudder to reflect that i have been the miserable origin and author? cursed be the day abhorred devil in which you first saw light cursed (although i curse myself) be the hands that formed you you have made me wretched beyond expression you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not begone relieve me from the sight of your detested form
thus i relieve thee my creator he said and placed his hated hands before my eyes which i flung from me with violence; thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion by the virtues that i once possessed i demand this from you hear my tale; it is long and strange and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain the sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin
as he said this he led the way across the ice; i followed my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion for the first time also i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness these motives urged me to comply with his demand we crossed the ice therefore and ascended the opposite rock the air was cold and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits but i consented to listen and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted he thus began his tale
chapter 11 it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time; and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight; but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt; and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep
it was dark when i awoke; i felt cold also and half frightened as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate before i had quitted your apartment on a sensation of cold i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night i was a poor helpless miserable wretch; i knew and could distinguish nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept
soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees [the moon] i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak with which i covered myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure
several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes i began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again
the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing
one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep
it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire i uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved
food however became scarce and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground
it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter; at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine; the latter however i did not like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep
it was noon when i awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground i determined to recommence my travels; and depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet i found i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village how miraculous did this appear the huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns the vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused; some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it my place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain
here then i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water one part was open and by that i had crept in; but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light i enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me
having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm
being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the rain-dropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard
on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food; and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions
soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire she afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots after he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together
the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures one was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency the old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields
night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds; i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters
the family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as i conjectured to rest
chapter 12 i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions
the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal
this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles
they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? they possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and still more they enjoyed one anothers company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply? did they really express pain? i was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic
a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves
this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood
i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days
i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden
by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose their pronunciation was quick and the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; i learned and applied the words _fire milk bread_ and _wood_ i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves the youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had only one which was _father_ the girl was called _sister_ or _agatha_ and the youth _felix brother_ or _son_ i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as _good dearest unhappy_
i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy i felt depressed; when they rejoiced i sympathised in their joys i saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends the old man i could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man
i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers in the midst of poverty and want felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha
this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour for i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted
i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace beauty and delicate complexions; but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror; and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity
as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth from this time felix was more employed and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared their food as i afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced
the old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters this frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been
my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was star-light i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage when i returned as often as it was necessary i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix i afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them; and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words _good spirit wonderful_; but i did not then understand the signification of these terms
my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought (foolish wretch) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flitted before me i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me i imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words i should first win their favour and afterwards their love
these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease it was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration
the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation the birds sang in more cheerful notes and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before was bleak damp and unwholesome my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory the present was tranquil and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy
chapter 13 i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am
spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty
it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar and the children listened to him—that i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door
it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a country-man as a guide the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided; her eyes were dark but gentle although animated; her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink
felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger she appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage some conversation took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately
i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian agatha the ever-gentle agatha kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others
as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible
the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods
when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music
the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy; she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors
in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered
my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language; and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken
while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight
the book from which felix instructed safie was volneys _ruins of empires_ i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it given very minute explanations he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants
these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base? he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments; but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing
every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood
the words induced me to turn towards myself i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i? of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; i was not even of the same nature as man i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat
of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was death—a state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me miserable unhappy wretch
other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds
but where were my friends and relations? no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i? the question again recurred to be answered only with groans
i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so i loved in an innocent half-painful self-deceit to call them)
chapter 14 some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was
the name of the old man was de lacey he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford
the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him he was tried and condemned to death the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation
felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard
the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness
during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate
i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha before i depart i will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you
safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks; recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements ill-suited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her
the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris
felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions
safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country
the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris
the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn; and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding
he did not succeed they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country
they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance
such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul
when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate
a few days after the turk entered his daughters apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours he intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn
when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany
she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world she fell however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover
chapter 15 such was the history of my beloved cottagers it impressed me deeply i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind
as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year
one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _paradise lost_ a volume of _plutarchs lives_ and the _sorrows of werter_ the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations
i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection in the _sorrows of werter_ besides the interest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension but it sank deep the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it
as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind; i was dependent on none and related to none the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean? who was i? what was i? whence did i come? what was my destination? these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them
the volume of _plutarchs lives_ which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the _sorrows of werter_ i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations
but _paradise lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me
another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible i sickened as i read hateful day when i received life i exclaimed in agony accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in disgust? god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred
these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship? i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity
several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade
i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo; and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation but it was all a dream; no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; i was alone i remembered adams supplication to his creator but where was mine? he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him
autumn passed thus i saw with surprise and grief the leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather; i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer they loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food or rest: i required kindness and sympathy; but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it
the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it; i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors
one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage when his children had departed he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection
my heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair all was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage
i knocked who is there? said the old man come in
i entered pardon this intrusion said i; i am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire
enter said de lacey and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants; but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you
do not trouble yourself my kind host; i have food; it is warmth and rest only that i need
i sat down and a silence ensued i knew that every minute was precious to me yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview when the old man addressed me
by your language stranger i suppose you are my countryman; are you french?
no; but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only i am now going to claim the protection of some friends whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hopes
are they germans? no they are french but let us change the subject i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me i am full of fears for if i fail there i am an outcast in the world for ever
do not despair to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest are full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair
they are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me i have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster
that is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless cannot you undeceive them?
i am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors i tenderly love these friends; i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome
where do these friends reside? near this spot
the old man paused and then continued if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature
excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness; and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures
heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue i also am unfortunate; i and my family have been condemned although innocent; judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes
how can i thank you my best and only benefactor? from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; i shall be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting
may i know the names and residence of those friends?
i paused this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial
great god exclaimed the old man who are you?
at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me? agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick i could have torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel
chapter 16 cursed cursed creator why did i live? why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? i know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery
when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save i were at rest or in enjoyment; i like the arch-fiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathised with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin
but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should i feel kindness towards my enemies? no; from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery
the sun rose; i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation
the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party
these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his fathers feet i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hiding-place and went in search of food
when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion; i cannot describe the agony of this suspense
presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations; but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man; i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances
do you consider said his companion to him that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden? i do not wish to take any unfair advantage and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination
it is utterly useless replied felix; we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related my wife and my sister will never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place
felix trembled violently as he said this he and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes and then departed i never saw any of the family of de lacey more
i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friends of the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations
as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand; it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues
as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods
and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps? i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator; and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life? among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted; i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed
but how was i to direct myself? i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being; but i did not despair from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form
my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh earth how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country; but i often wandered wide from my path the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings
i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me
i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream i rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood
this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused and i fainted
for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate i had no means of extracting it my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured
after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure
but my toils now drew near a close and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva
it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura
at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth
urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said child what is the meaning of this? i do not intend to hurt you; listen to me
he struggled violently let me go he cried; monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces you are an ogre let me go or i will tell my papa
boy you will never see your father again; you must come with me
hideous monster let me go my papa is a syndic—he is m frankenstein—he will punish you you dare not keep me
frankenstein you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim
the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; i grasped his throat to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my feet
i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands i exclaimed i too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him
as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast i took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; i remembered that i was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright
can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them
while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hiding-place i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty a woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered awake fairest thy lover is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved awake
the sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer? thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me the thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not i but she shall suffer; the murder i have committed because i am for ever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress she moved again and i fled
for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition i am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects this being you must create
chapter 17 the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition he continued
you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede
the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me
i do refuse it i replied; and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answered you; you may torture me but i will never consent
you are in the wrong replied the fiend; and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned and hated by all mankind? you my creator would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me? you would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame the work of your own hands shall i respect man when he condemns me? let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injuries; if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred have a care; i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth
a fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—
i intended to reason this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creatures sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate; i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small but it is all that i can receive and it shall content me it is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request
i was moved i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? he saw my change of feeling and continued
if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; i will go to the vast wilds of south america my food is not that of man; i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire
you propose replied i to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile? you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction this may not be; cease to argue the point for i cannot consent
how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker
his words had a strange effect upon me i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred i tried to stifle these sensations; i thought that as i could not sympathise with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow
you swear i said to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?
how is this? i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer if i have no ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded
i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request turning to him therefore i said
i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever and every other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile
i swear he cried by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and commence your labours; i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear
saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice
his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy and my steps slow the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced night was far advanced when i came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness
these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me
morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix; i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak i felt as if i were placed under a ban—as if i had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i loved them to adoration; and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life
chapter 18 day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva; and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit england for this purpose; but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me; my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored; and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart
it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me
i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all
i trembled violently at his exordium and my father continued—
i confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together and appeared in dispositions and tastes entirely suited to one another but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife nay you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel
my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union
the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage we have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities you are younger; yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity
i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground? i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace
i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror i was aware also that i should often lose all self-command all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfilled the monster would depart for ever or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever
these feelings dictated my answer to my father i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself
the duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?
to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return my fathers age rendered him extremely averse to delay for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her
i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england? this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations
it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief it had been her care which provided me a companion in clerval—and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans sedulous attention she longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell
i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured
after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i waited two days for clerval he came alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky this is what it is to live he cried; now i enjoy existence but you my dear frankenstein wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment
we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrived at mainz the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene
we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry? he felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country; i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud; but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country
clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving he was a being formed in the very poetry of nature his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he loved with ardour:—
——the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion: the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite; a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrowd from the eye [wordsworths tintern abbey]
and where does he now exist? is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this mind perished? does it now only exist in my memory? no it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend
pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates i will proceed with my tale
beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us
our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but we arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to england it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first saw the white cliffs of britain the banks of the thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwich—places which i had heard of even in my country
at length we saw the numerous steeples of london st pauls towering above all and the tower famed in english history
chapter 19 london was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object; i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers
if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound company was irksome to me; when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish
but in clerval i saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he was for ever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate
after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation and i although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places
we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of july i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland
we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest this was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us
from thence we proceeded to oxford as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before it was here that charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we delighted to trace its footsteps if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees
i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future i was formed for peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by _ennui_ the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits but i am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself
we passed a considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self
we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated
from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors i could pass my life here said he to me; and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine
but he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments his feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties
we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on for my own part i was not sorry i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the dæmons disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace i waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime
i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being clerval did not like it so well as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romantic castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthurs seat st bernards well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey
we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st andrews and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone do you said i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper
henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate he entreated me to write often i had rather be with you he said in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know; hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence
having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion
with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured from the mainland which was about five miles distant
on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty as it was i lived ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men
in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet it was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene i thought of switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean
in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work it was indeed a filthy process in which i was engaged during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands
thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal; i grew restless and nervous every moment i feared to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion
in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom
chapter 20 i sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set and the moon was just rising from the sea; i had not sufficient light for my employment and i remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but she had not; and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation they might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? she also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species
even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror had i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created; i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race
i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me yes he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise
as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew
i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then with trembling steps i sought my own apartment i was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries
several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house
in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly i trembled from head to foot; i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but i was overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot
presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared shutting the door he approached me and said in a smothered voice
you have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend? do you dare to break your promise? i have endured toil and misery; i left switzerland with you; i crept along the shores of the rhine among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?
begone i do break my promise; never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and wickedness
slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension remember that i have power; you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you you are my creator but i am your master; obey
the hour of my irresolution is past and the period of your power is arrived your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness? begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage
the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger shall each man cried he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone? i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? you can blast my other passions but revenge remains—revenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom man you shall repent of the injuries you inflict
devil cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words leave me; i am inexorable
it is well i go; but remember i shall be with you on your wedding-night
i started forward and exclaimed villain before you sign my death-warrant be sure that you are yourself safe
i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves
all was again silent but his words rang in my ears i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? but i had suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland i shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge and then i thought again of his words—_i will be with you on your wedding-night_ that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me to fear; yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the first i had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle
the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair i left the house the horrid scene of the last nights contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me i desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery if i returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a dæmon whom i had myself created
i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me; and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality
the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishing-boat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days
yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shuddered to reflect; i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpose i must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory the remains of the half-finished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and i accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus
nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled; but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion
between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and i then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore the scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land but i sailed away from them i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures at one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; i listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot the sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly
i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably the wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror i had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me i had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings i looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave fiend i exclaimed your task is already fulfilled i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clerval—all left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever i shudder to reflect on it
some hours passed thus; but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers but these gave place to a heavy swell; i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south
almost spent as i was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes
how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land it had a wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory as i was in a state of extreme debility i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money with me as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape
as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language my good friends said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am?
you will know that soon enough replied a man with a hoarse voice maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consulted as to your quarters i promise you
i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions why do you answer me so roughly? i replied surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably
i do not know said the man what the custom of the english may be but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains
while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me i inquired the way to the inn but no one replied i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said come sir you must follow me to mr kirwins to give an account of yourself
who is mr kirwin? why am i to give an account of myself? is not this a free country?
ay sir free enough for honest folks mr kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night
this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself i was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death
i must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which i am about to relate in proper detail to my recollection
chapter 21 i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion
about half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law daniel nugent when about ten oclock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck
the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner
the son confirmed his fathers account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed
a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found
another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone
several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of —— from the place where i had deposited the corpse
mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair
i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it? i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life? two i have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you clerval my friend my benefactor—
the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured and i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions
a fever succeeded to this i lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful; i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented; and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror fortunately as i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses
why did i not die? more miserable than man ever was before why did i not sink into forgetfulness and rest? death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture?
but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding; i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly
this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in english and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings
are you better now sir? said she
i replied in the same language with a feeble voice i believe i am; but if it be all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror
for that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however thats none of my business; i am sent to nurse you and get you well; i do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same
i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death; but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality
as the images that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?
these were my first reflections but i soon learned that mr kirwin had shown me extreme kindness he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals
one day while i was gradually recovering i was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness at one time i considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr kirwin entered his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in french
i fear that this place is very shocking to you; can i do anything to make you more comfortable?
i thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving
i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge
that is my least concern; i am by a course of strange events become the most miserable of mortals persecuted and tortured as i am and have been can death be any evil to me?
nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path
as mr kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for mr kirwin hastened to say
immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness i found several letters and among others one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father i instantly wrote to geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter but you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind
this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted and whose murder i am now to lament?
your family is perfectly well said mr kirwin with gentleness; and someone a friend is come to visit you
i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony
oh take him away i cannot see him; for gods sake do not let him enter
mr kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance he could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone
i should have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance
my father cried i while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure is my father indeed come? how kind how very kind but where is he why does he not hasten to me?
my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it
nothing at this moment could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father i stretched out my hand to him and cried
are you then safe—and elizabeth—and ernest?
my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness what a place is this that you inhabit my son said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room you travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you and poor clerval—
the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; i shed tears
alas yes my father replied i; some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me and i must live to fulfil it or surely i should have died on the coffin of henry
we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health
as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the image of clerval was for ever before me ghastly and murdered more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life? it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny which is now drawing to a close soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins
the season of the assizes approached i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held mr kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison
my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful the cup of life was poisoned for ever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt
my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring _maladie du pays_ to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence
yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being my strength was gone i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame
still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father thought it best to yield we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havre-de-grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores it was midnight i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived i was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly
ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare; i felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears my father who was watching over me perceiving my restlessness awoke me; the dashing waves were around the cloudy sky above the fiend was not here: a sense of security a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible
chapter 22 the voyage came to an end we landed and proceeded to paris i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey my fathers care and attentions were indefatigable but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill he wished me to seek amusement in society i abhorred the face of man oh not abhorred they were my brethren my fellow beings and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me
my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride
alas my father said i how little do you know me human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine was as innocent as i and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and i am the cause of this—i murdered her william justine and henry—they all died by my hands
my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion; when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i preserved in my convalescence i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe
upon this occasion my father said with an expression of unbounded wonder my dearest victor what infatuation is this? my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again
i am not mad i cried energetically; the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth i am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations a thousand times would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives; but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race
the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes
as time passed away i became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them by the utmost self-violence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice
a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland i received the following letter from elizabeth:
my dear friend it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense; yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity
yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet
explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain? if you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence i have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin
you well know victor that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy we were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place we were affectionate playfellows during childhood and i believe dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older but as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be our case? tell me dearest victor answer me i conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truth—do you not love another?
you have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt; and i confess to you my friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying to solitude from the society of every creature i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations but this is false reasoning i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice even now i weep to think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word _honour_ all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes ah victor be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition be happy my friend; and if you obey me in this one request remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity
do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow or the next day or even until you come if it will give you pain my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness
elizabeth lavenza geneva may 18th 17—
this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten the threat of the fiend—_i will be with you on your wedding-night_ such was my sentence and on that night would the dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings on that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death well be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place in which if he were victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end if he were vanquished i should be a free man alas what freedom? such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste and he is turned adrift homeless penniless and alone but free such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death
sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable; yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge he had vowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_ yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour
in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth my letter was calm and affectionate i fear my beloved girl i said little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you chase away your idle fears; to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment i have one secret elizabeth a dreadful one; when revealed to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured i will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confidence between us but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude to it this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply
in about a week after the arrival of elizabeths letter we returned to geneva the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks i saw a change in her also she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i was
the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure memory brought madness with it and when i thought of what had passed a real insanity possessed me; sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage sometimes low and despondent i neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me
elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor she wept with me and for me when reason returned she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned but for the guilty there is no peace the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief
soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with elizabeth i remained silent
have you then some other attachment?
none on earth i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight let the day therefore be fixed; and on it i will consecrate myself in life or death to the happiness of my cousin
my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune and when time shall have softened your despair new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived
such were the lessons of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood i should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words _i shall be with you on your wedding-night_ i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it and i therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as i imagined the seal to my fate
great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage but as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death i hastened that of a far dearer victim
as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink within me but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of elizabeth she looked forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret
preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were received and all wore a smiling appearance i shut up as well as i could in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her it was agreed that immediately after our union we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood
in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent
elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny she was melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride
after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day the day was fair the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation
those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness we passed rapidly along; the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont salêve the pleasant banks of montalègre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it
i took the hand of elizabeth you are sorrowful my love ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy
be happy my dear victor replied elizabeth; there is i hope nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is contented something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us but i will not listen to such a sinister voice observe how fast we move along and how the clouds which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears
thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects but her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie
the sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills the alps here come closer to the lake and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary the spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung
the wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as i touched the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever
chapter 23 it was eight oclock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines
the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended
i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind i was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished
elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her and trembling she asked what is it that agitates you my dear victor? what is it you fear?
oh peace peace my love replied i; this night and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful very dreadful
i passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflected how fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife and i earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy
she left me and i continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated and i rushed into the room
great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live? alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated for a moment only did i lose recollection; i fell senseless on the ground
when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have supposed her asleep i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips
while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look up the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife i rushed towards the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom fired; but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake
the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room i pointed to the spot where he had disappeared and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines
i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house but my head whirled round my steps were like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost
after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around; i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind but my thoughts rambled to various subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife; even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed
there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night i hired men to row and took an oar myself for i had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise but the overflowing misery i now felt and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion i threw down the oar and leaning my head upon my hands gave way to every gloomy idea that arose if i looked up i saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection tears streamed from my eyes the rain had ceased for a moment and i saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by elizabeth nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change the sun might shine or the clouds might lower but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as i was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man
but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? mine has been a tale of horrors; i have reached their _acme_ and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you know that one by one my friends were snatched away; i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration
i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore i see him now excellent and venerable old man his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm and their delight—his elizabeth his more than daughter whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels who in the decline of life having few affections clings more earnestly to those that remain cursed cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed and in a few days he died in my arms
what then became of me? i know not; i lost sensation and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation
liberty however had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awakened to reason at the same time awakened to revenge as the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me i began to reflect on their cause—the monster whom i had created the miserable dæmon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head
nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; i began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose about a month after my release i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer
the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness be assured sir said he no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain
i thank you replied i; listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make it is indeed a tale so strange that i should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm; i had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation
the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested; i saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise unmingled with disbelief was painted on his countenance
when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power it is your duty as a magistrate and i believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion
this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity returned he however answered mildly i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude? besides some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit
i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert
as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable; and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment
that cannot be; but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you; yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand; i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction
i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this; there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed but to a genevan magistrate whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium
man i cried how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease; you know not what it is you say
i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action
chapter 24 my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion
my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever; my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed
and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know; many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive; i dared not die and leave my adversary in being
when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner
the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair they were dead and i lived; their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear; and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpose i will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me
i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance
i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a well-known and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied
i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed
i pursued him and for many months this has been my task guided by a slight clue i followed the windings of the rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appeared and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i took my passage in the same ship but he escaped i know not how
amidst the wilds of tartary and russia although he still evaded me i have ever followed in his track sometimes the peasants scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path; sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel? cold want and fatigue were the least pains which i was destined to endure; i was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had invoked to aid me often when all was dry the heavens cloudless and i was parched by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drops that revived me and vanish
i followed when i could the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected in other places human beings were seldom seen and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or i brought with me some food that i had killed which after taking a small part i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking
my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprived of this respite i should have sunk under my hardships during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country; again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul
what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know sometimes indeed he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury my reign is not yet over—these words were legible in one of these inscriptions—you live and my power is complete follow me; i seek the everlasting ices of the north where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare; eat and be refreshed come on my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive
scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance; again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish; and then with what ecstasy shall i join my elizabeth and my departed friends who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage
as i still pursued my journey to the northward the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured; and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance
the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours one inscription that he left was in these words: prepare your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred
my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; i resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversarys gibe to meet and grapple with him
some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed i know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but i found that as before i had daily lost ground in the pursuit i now gained on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean he was but one days journey in advance and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horror-struck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts
on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair he had escaped me and i must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge i prepared for my journey
i exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions i departed from land
i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage and i often heard the thunder of the ground sea which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure
by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dæmon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud
but this was not the time for delay; i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hours rest which was absolutely necessary and yet which was bitterly irksome to me i continued my route the sledge was still visible nor did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant my heart bounded within me
but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before a ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more ominous and terrific i pressed on but in vain the wind arose; the sea roared; and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death
in this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i had determined if you were going southwards still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled
oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the dæmon allow me the rest i so much desire; or must i die and he yet live? if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone? no; i am not so selfish yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not his soul is as hellish as his form full of treachery and fiend-like malice hear him not; call on the names of william justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart i will hover near and direct the steel aright
walton _in continuation_ august 26th 17—
you have read this strange and terrific story margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdles mine? sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale; at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish his fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice suppressing every mark of agitation; then like a volcano bursting forth his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor
his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie which he showed me and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations however earnest and connected such a monster has then really existence i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surprise and admiration sometimes i endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his creatures formation but on this point he was impenetrable
are you mad my friend? said he or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy? peace peace learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own
frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy since you have preserved my narration said he i would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity
thus has a week passed away while i have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live? oh no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death yet he enjoys one comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance that they are not the creations of his fancy but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth
our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension his eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can i hear him when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love without tears what a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin he seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall
when younger said he i believed myself destined for some great enterprise my feelings are profound but i possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements this sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures when i reflected on the work i had completed no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors but this thought which supported me in the commencement of my career now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust all my speculations and hopes are as nothing and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence i am chained in an eternal hell my imagination was vivid yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities i conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man even now i cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete i trod heaven in my thoughts now exulting in my powers now burning with the idea of their effects from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i once was you would not recognise me in this state of degradation despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on until i fell never never again to rise
must i then lose this admirable being? i have longed for a friend; i have sought one who would sympathise with and love me behold on these desert seas i have found such a one but i fear i have gained him only to know his value and lose him i would reconcile him to life but he repulses the idea
i thank you walton he said for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone? can any man be to me as clerval was or any woman another elizabeth? even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain they know our infantine dispositions which however they may be afterwards modified are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however strongly he may be attached may in spite of himself be contemplated with suspicion but i enjoyed friends dear not only through habit and association but from their own merits; and wherever i am the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear they are dead and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life if i were engaged in any high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures then could i live to fulfil it but such is not my destiny; i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die
my beloved sister september 2d i write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel the brave fellows whom i have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow there is something terribly appalling in our situation yet my courage and hopes do not desert me yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me if we are lost my mad schemes are the cause
and what margaret will be the state of your mind? you will not hear of my destruction and you will anxiously await my return years will pass and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope oh my beloved sister the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is in prospect more terrible to me than my own death but you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy heaven bless you and make you so
my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued he reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea and in spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks they no longer despair; he rouses their energies and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man these feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair
september 5th a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you yet i cannot forbear recording it
we are still surrounded by mountains of ice still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict the cold is excessive and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is exhausted and when suddenly roused to any exertion he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness
i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny this morning as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—i was roused by half a dozen of the sailors who demanded admission into the cabin they entered and their leader addressed me he told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which in justice i could not refuse we were immured in ice and should probably never escape but they feared that if as was possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this they insisted therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards
this speech troubled me i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free yet could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand? i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had at first been silent and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now roused himself; his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour turning towards the men he said
what do you mean? what do you demand of your captain? are you then so easily turned from your design? did you not call this a glorious expedition? and wherefore was it glorious? not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea but because it was full of dangers and terror because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited because danger and death surrounded it and these you were to brave and overcome for this was it a glorious for this was it an honourable undertaking you were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now behold with the first imagination of danger or if you will the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so poor souls they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides why that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards oh be men or be more than men be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe
he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism that can you wonder that these men were moved? they looked at one another and were unable to reply i spoke; i told them to retire and consider of what had been said that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary but that i hoped that with reflection their courage would return
they retired and i turned towards my friend but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life
how all this will terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled yet i fear such will be my fate; the men unsupported by ideas of glory and honour can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships
september 7th the die is cast; i have consented to return if we are not destroyed thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; i come back ignorant and disappointed it requires more philosophy than i possess to bear this injustice with patience
september 12th it is past; i am returning to england i have lost my hopes of utility and glory; i have lost my friend but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister; and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond
september 9th the ice began to move and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction we were in the most imminent peril but as we could only remain passive my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed the ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them loud and long-continued frankenstein who was dozing awoke and asked the cause of the tumult they shout i said because they will soon return to england
do you then really return? alas yes; i cannot withstand their demands i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger and i must return
do so if you will; but i will not you may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength saying this he endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted
it was long before he was restored and i often thought that life was entirely extinct at length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live
his sentence was pronounced and i could only grieve and be patient i sat by his bed watching him; his eyes were closed and i thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said alas the strength i relied on is gone; i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and persecutor may still be in being think not walton that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed; but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do i find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness and well-being this was my duty but there was another still paramount to that my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery urged by this view i refused and i did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations happiness and wisdom; nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end miserable himself that he may render no other wretched he ought to die the task of his destruction was mine but i have failed when actuated by selfish and vicious motives i asked you to undertake my unfinished work and i renew this request now when i am only induced by reason and virtue
yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to england you will have little chance of meeting with him but the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties i leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may still be misled by passion
that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects this hour when i momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years the forms of the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arms farewell walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries yet why do i say this? i have myself been blasted in these hopes yet another may succeed
his voice became fainter as he spoke and at length exhausted by his effort he sank into silence about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips
margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble my tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment but i journey towards england and i may there find consolation
i am interrupted what do these sounds portend? it is midnight; the breeze blows fairly and the watch on deck scarcely stir again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie i must arise and examine good night my sister
great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe
i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describe—gigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay
he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion
that is also my victim he exclaimed in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and self-devoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me? i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me
his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being; i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion
your repentance i said is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived
and do you dream? said the dæmon do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse? he he continued pointing to the corpse he suffered not in the consummation of the deed oh not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears? my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine
after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heart-broken and overcome i pitied frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended; there is my last victim
i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me wretch i said it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power
oh it is not thus—not thus interrupted the being yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed that i wished to be participated but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy? i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when i die i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation; i am alone
you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they were for ever ardent and craving; still i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned was there no injustice in this? am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me? why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely? why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice
but it is true that i am a wretch i have murdered the lovely and the helpless; i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men to misery; i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin there he lies white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hands which executed the deed; i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more
fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief my work is nearly complete neither yours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done but it requires my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied yet unquenched he is dead who called me into being; and when i shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks light feeling and sense will pass away; and in this condition must i find my happiness some years ago when the images which this world affords first opened upon me when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds and these were all to me i should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse where can i find rest but in death?
farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction but it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction that i might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceased to think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel blasted as thou wert my agony was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever
but soon he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt soon these burning miseries will be extinct i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames the light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds my spirit will sleep in peace or if it thinks it will not surely think thus farewell
he sprang from the cabin-window as he said this upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel he was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance
i introduction the time traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us his pale grey eyes shone and twinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated the fire burnt brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision and he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity
you must follow me carefully i shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted the geometry for instance they taught you at school is founded on a misconception
is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon? said filby an argumentative person with red hair
i do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you know of course that a mathematical line a line of thickness _nil_ has no real existence they taught you that? neither has a mathematical plane these things are mere abstractions
that is all right said the psychologist
nor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have a real existence
there i object said filby of course a solid body may exist all real things—
so most people think but wait a moment can an _instantaneous_ cube exist?
dont follow you said filby can a cube that does not last for any time at all have a real existence?
filby became pensive clearly the time traveller proceeded any real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have length breadth thickness and—duration but through a natural infirmity of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we incline to overlook this fact there are really four dimensions three which we call the three planes of space and a fourth time there is however a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives
that said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; that    very clear indeed
now it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked continued the time traveller with a slight accession of cheerfulness really this is what is meant by the fourth dimension though some people who talk about the fourth dimension do not know they mean it it is only another way of looking at time _there is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space except that our consciousness moves along it_ but some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea you have all heard what they have to say about this fourth dimension?
_i_ have not said the provincial mayor
it is simply this that space as our mathematicians have it is spoken of as having three dimensions which one may call length breadth and thickness and is always definable by reference to three planes each at right angles to the others but some philosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even tried to construct a four-dimensional geometry professor simon newcomb was expounding this to the new york mathematical society only a month or so ago you know how on a flat surface which has only two dimensions we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the thing see?
i think so murmured the provincial mayor; and knitting his brows he lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words yes i think i see it now he said after some time brightening in a quite transitory manner
well i do not mind telling you i have been at work upon this geometry of four dimensions for some time some of my results are curious for instance here is a portrait of a man at eight years old another at fifteen another at seventeen another at twenty-three and so on all these are evidently sections as it were three-dimensional representations of his four-dimensioned being which is a fixed and unalterable thing
scientific people proceeded the time traveller after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this know very well that time is only a kind of space here is a popular scientific diagram a weather record this line i trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterday night it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to here surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of space generally recognised? but certainly it traced such a line and that line therefore we must conclude was along the time-dimension
but said the medical man staring hard at a coal in the fire if time is really only a fourth dimension of space why is it and why has it always been regarded as something different? and why cannot we move in time as we move about in the other dimensions of space?
the time traveller smiled are you so sure we can move freely in space? right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough and men always have done so i admit we move freely in two dimensions but how about up and down? gravitation limits us there
not exactly said the medical man there are balloons
but before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical movement
still they could move a little up and down said the medical man
easier far easier down than up
and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the present moment
my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have no dimensions are passing along the time-dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel _down_ if we began our existence fifty miles above the earths surface
but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist you _can_ move about in all directions of space but you cannot move about in time
that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence: i become absent-minded as you say i jump back for a moment of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground but a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the time-dimension or even turn about and travel the other way?
oh _this_ began filby is all—
why not? said the time traveller
its against reason said filby what reason? said the time traveller
you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will never convince me
possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of four dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine—
to travel through time exclaimed the very young man
that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time as the driver determines
filby contented himself with laughter but i have experimental verification said the time traveller
it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance
dont you think you would attract attention? said the medical man our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms
one might get ones greek from the very lips of homer and plato the very young man thought
in which case they would certainly plough you for the little-go the german scholars have improved greek so much
then there is the future said the very young man just think one might invest all ones money leave it to accumulate at interest and hurry on ahead
to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic basis
of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist
yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until—
experimental verification cried i you are going to verify _that_?
the experiment cried filby who was getting brain-weary
lets see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though its all humbug you know
the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory
the psychologist looked at us i wonder what hes got?
some sleight-of-hand trick or other said the medical man and filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at burslem but before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and filbys anecdote collapsed
ii the machine the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played upon us under these conditions
the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well? said the psychologist
this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also here is one little white lever and here is another
the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing its beautifully made he said
it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said: now i want you clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over sends the machine gliding into the future and this other reverses the motion this saddle represents the seat of a time traveller presently i am going to press the lever and off the machine will go it will vanish pass into future time and disappear have a good look at the thing look at the table too and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery i dont want to waste this model and then be told im a quack
there was a minutes pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about to speak to me but changed his mind then the time traveller put forth his finger towards the lever no he said suddenly lend me your hand and turning to the psychologist he took that individuals hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger so that it was the psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machine on its interminable voyage we all saw the lever turn i am absolutely certain there was no trickery there was a breath of wind and the lamp flame jumped one of the candles on the mantel was blown out and the little machine suddenly swung round became indistinct was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone—vanished save for the lamp the table was bare
everyone was silent for a minute then filby said he was damned
the psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked under the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully well? he said with a reminiscence of the psychologist then getting up he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his back to us began to fill his pipe
we stared at each other look here said the medical man are you in earnest about this? do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?
certainly said the time traveller stooping to light a spill at the fire then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the psychologists face (the psychologist to show that he was not unhinged helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut) what is more i have a big machine nearly finished in there—he indicated the laboratory—and when that is put together i mean to have a journey on my own account
you mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future? said filby
into the future or the past—i dont for certain know which
after an interval the psychologist had an inspiration it must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere he said
why? said the time traveller because i presume that it has not moved in space and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time since it must have travelled through this time
but said i if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when we came first into this room; and last thursday when we were here; and the thursday before that; and so forth
serious objections remarked the provincial mayor with an air of impartiality turning towards the time traveller
not a bit said the time traveller and to the psychologist: you think _you_ can explain that its presentation below the threshold you know diluted presentation
of course said the psychologist and reassured us thats a simple point of psychology i should have thought of it its plain enough and helps the paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor can we appreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning or a bullet flying through the air if it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are if it gets through a minute while we get through a second the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time thats plain enough he passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been you see? he said laughing
we sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so then the time traveller asked us what we thought of it all
it sounds plausible enough tonight said the medical man; but wait until tomorrow wait for the common sense of the morning
would you like to see the time machine itself? asked the time traveller and therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the way down the long draughty corridor to his laboratory i remember vividly the flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette the dance of the shadows how we all followed him puzzled but incredulous and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes parts were of nickel parts of ivory parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal the thing was generally complete but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings and i took one up for a better look at it quartz it seemed to be
look here said the medical man are you perfectly serious? or is this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last christmas?
upon that machine said the time traveller holding the lamp aloft i intend to explore time is that plain? i was never more serious in my life
none of us quite knew how to take it
i caught filbys eye over the shoulder of the medical man and he winked at me solemnly
iii the time traveller returns i think that at that time none of us quite believed in the time machine the fact is the time traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown the model and explained the matter in the time travellers words we should have shown _him_ far less scepticism for we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand filby but the time traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements and we distrusted him things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands it is a mistake to do things too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china so i dont think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that thursday and the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt in most of our minds: its plausibility that is its practical incredibleness the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested for my own part i was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model that i remember discussing with the medical man whom i met on friday at the linnæan he said he had seen a similar thing at tübingen and laid considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle but how the trick was done he could not explain
the next thursday i went again to richmond—i suppose i was one of the time travellers most constant guests—and arriving late found four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other i looked round for the time traveller and—its half-past seven now said the medical man i suppose wed better have dinner?
wheres——? said i naming our host
youve just come? its rather odd hes unavoidably detained he asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if hes not back says hell explain when he comes
it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil said the editor of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the doctor rang the bell
the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner the other men were blank the editor aforementioned a certain journalist and another—a quiet shy man with a beard—whom i didnt know and who as far as my observation went never opened his mouth all the evening there was some speculation at the dinner-table about the time travellers absence and i suggested time travelling in a half-jocular spirit the editor wanted that explained to him and the psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ingenious paradox and trick we had witnessed that day week he was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise i was facing the door and saw it first hallo i said at last and the door opened wider and the time traveller stood before us i gave a cry of surprise good heavens man whats the matter? cried the medical man who saw him next and the whole tableful turned towards the door
he was in an amazing plight his coat was dusty and dirty and smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered and as it seemed to me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded his face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn as by intense suffering for a moment he hesitated in the doorway as if he had been dazzled by the light then he came into the room he walked with just such a limp as i have seen in footsore tramps we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak
he said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a motion towards the wine the editor filled a glass of champagne and pushed it towards him he drained it and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face what on earth have you been up to man? said the doctor the time traveller did not seem to hear dont let me disturb you he said with a certain faltering articulation im all right he stopped held out his glass for more and took it off at a draught thats good he said his eyes grew brighter and a faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval and then went round the warm and comfortable room then he spoke again still as it were feeling his way among his words im going to wash and dress and then ill come down and explain things save me some of that mutton im starving for a bit of meat
he looked across at the editor who was a rare visitor and hoped he was all right the editor began a question tell you presently said the time traveller im—funny be all right in a minute
he put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door again i remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall and standing up in my place i saw his feet as he went out he had nothing on them but a pair of tattered blood-stained socks then the door closed upon him i had half a mind to follow till i remembered how he detested any fuss about himself for a minute perhaps my mind was wool-gathering then remarkable behaviour of an eminent scientist i heard the editor say thinking (after his wont) in headlines and this brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table
whats the game? said the journalist has he been doing the amateur cadger? i dont follow i met the eye of the psychologist and read my own interpretation in his face i thought of the time traveller limping painfully upstairs i dont think anyone else had noticed his lameness
the first to recover completely from this surprise was the medical man who rang the bell—the time traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner—for a hot plate at that the editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt and the silent man followed suit the dinner was resumed conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of wonderment; and then the editor got fervent in his curiosity does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his nebuchadnezzar phases? he inquired i feel assured its this business of the time machine i said and took up the psychologists account of our previous meeting the new guests were frankly incredulous the editor raised objections what _was_ this time travelling? a man couldnt cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox could he? and then as the idea came home to him he resorted to caricature hadnt they any clothes-brushes in the future? the journalist too would not believe at any price and joined the editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing they were both the new kind of journalist—very joyous irreverent young men our special correspondent in the day after tomorrow reports the journalist was saying—or rather shouting—when the time traveller came back he was dressed in ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me
i say said the editor hilariously these chaps here say you have been travelling into the middle of next week tell us all about little rosebery will you? what will you take for the lot?
the time traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word he smiled quietly in his old way wheres my mutton? he said what a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again
story cried the editor story be damned said the time traveller i want something to eat i wont say a word until i get some peptone into my arteries thanks and the salt
one word said i have you been time travelling?
yes said the time traveller with his mouth full nodding his head
id give a shilling a line for a verbatim note said the editor the time traveller pushed his glass towards the silent man and rang it with his fingernail; at which the silent man who had been staring at his face started convulsively and poured him wine the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable for my own part sudden questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same with the others the journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of hettie potter the time traveller devoted his attention to his dinner and displayed the appetite of a tramp the medical man smoked a cigarette and watched the time traveller through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness at last the time traveller pushed his plate away and looked round us i suppose i must apologise he said i was simply starving ive had a most amazing time he reached out his hand for a cigar and cut the end but come into the smoking-room its too long a story to tell over greasy plates and ringing the bell in passing he led the way into the adjoining room
you have told blank and dash and chose about the machine? he said to me leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests
but the things a mere paradox said the editor
i cant argue tonight i dont mind telling you the story but i cant argue i will he went on tell you the story of what has happened to me if you like but you must refrain from interruptions i want to tell it badly most of it will sound like lying so be it its true—every word of it all the same i was in my laboratory at four oclock and since then … ive lived eight days … such days as no human being ever lived before im nearly worn out but i shant sleep till ive told this thing over to you then i shall go to bed but no interruptions is it agreed?
agreed said the editor and the rest of us echoed agreed and with that the time traveller began his story as i have set it forth he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man afterwards he got more animated in writing it down i feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and above all my own inadequacy—to express its quality you read i will suppose attentively enough; but you cannot see the speakers white sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp nor hear the intonation of his voice you cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story most of us hearers were in shadow for the candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted and only the face of the journalist and the legs of the silent man from the knees downward were illuminated at first we glanced now and again at each other after a time we ceased to do that and looked only at the time travellers face
iv time travelling i told some of you last thursday of the principles of the time machine and showed you the actual thing itself incomplete in the workshop there it is now a little travel-worn truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked and a brass rail bent; but the rest of its sound enough i expected to finish it on friday; but on friday when the putting together was nearly done i found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short and this i had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning it was at ten oclock today that the first of all time machines began its career i gave it a last tap tried all the screws again put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod and sat myself in the saddle i suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as i felt then i took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other pressed the first and almost immediately the second i seemed to reel; i felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and looking round i saw the laboratory exactly as before had anything happened? for a moment i suspected that my intellect had tricked me then i noted the clock a moment before as it seemed it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three
i drew a breath set my teeth gripped the starting lever with both hands and went off with a thud the laboratory got hazy and went dark mrs watchett came in and walked apparently without seeing me towards the garden door i suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket i pressed the lever over to its extreme position the night came like the turning out of a lamp and in another moment came tomorrow the laboratory grew faint and hazy then fainter and ever fainter tomorrow night came black then day again night again day again faster and faster still an eddying murmur filled my ears and a strange dumb confusedness descended on my mind
i am afraid i cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling they are excessively unpleasant there is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion i felt the same horrible anticipation too of an imminent smash as i put on pace night followed day like the flapping of a black wing the dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me and i saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky leaping it every minute and every minute marking a day i supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and i had come into the open air i had a dim impression of scaffolding but i was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things the slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me the twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye then in the intermittent darknesses i saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars presently as i went on still gaining velocity the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue a splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire a brilliant arch in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and i could see nothing of the stars save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue
the landscape was misty and vague i was still on the hillside upon which this house now stands and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim i saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour now brown now green; they grew spread shivered and passed away i saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair and pass like dreams the whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring
the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they took complete possession of me what strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation i thought might not appear when i came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the hillside and remain there without any wintry intermission even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair and so my mind came round to the business of stopping
the peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely mattered: i was so to speak attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching explosion—would result and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i was making the machine; but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man has got to take now the risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerves i told myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was flung headlong through the air
there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hailstones the rebounding dancing hail hung in a little cloud over the machine and drove along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you
presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour but all else of the world was invisible
my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very large for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder it was of white marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather-worn and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute perhaps or half an hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun
i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? what might not have happened to men? what if cruelty had grown into a common passion? what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly powerful? i might seem some old-world savage animal only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently slain
already i saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again
but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had seen me and their faces were directed towards me
then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature—perhaps four feet high—clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a leather belt sandals or buskins—i could not clearly distinguish which—were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees and his head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm the air was
he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence i took my hands from the machine
v in the golden age in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue
there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in these pretty little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of communication
and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a point the eyes were large and mild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest i might have expected in them
as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the sound of thunder
for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools? you may hardly understand how it took me you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children—asked me in fact if i had come from the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt that i had built the time machine in vain
i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck the idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible merriment to my mind
the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons
the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw suggestions of old phœnician decorations as i passed through and it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments looking grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech
the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal not plates nor slabs—blocks and it was so much worn as i judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits some i recognised as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange but for the most part they were strange
between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i surveyed the hall at my leisure
and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look the stained-glass windows which displayed only a geometrical pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material
fruit by the bye was all their diet these people of the remote future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful; one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was there—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to perceive their import
however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount of genuine if uncivil amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at least at my command; and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more easily fatigued
vi the sunset of mankind a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way leave me again to my own devices
the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely different from the world i had known—even the flowers the big building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one ad for that i should explain was the date the little dials of my machine recorded
as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i found the world—for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have a very strange experience—the first intimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that i will speak in its proper place
looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i rested for a while i realised that there were no small houses to be seen apparently the single house and possibly even the household had vanished here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings but the house and the cottage which form such characteristic features of our own english landscape had disappeared
communism said i to myself and on the heels of that came another thought i looked at the half-dozen little figures that were following me then in a flash i perceived that all had the same form of costume the same soft hairless visage and the same girlish rotundity of limb it may seem strange perhaps that i had not noticed this before but everything was so strange now i saw the fact plainly enough in costume and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other these people of the future were alike and the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents i judged then that the children of that time were extremely precocious physically at least and i found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion
seeing the ease and security in which these people were living i felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman the institution of the family and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical force where population is balanced and abundant much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the state; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are secure there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an efficient family and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to their childrens needs disappears we see some beginnings of this even in our own time and in this future age it was complete this i must remind you was my speculation at the time later i was to appreciate how far it fell short of the reality
while i was musing upon these things my attention was attracted by a pretty little structure like a well under a cupola i thought in a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing and then resumed the thread of my speculations there were no large buildings towards the top of the hill and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous i was presently left alone for the first time with a strange sense of freedom and adventure i pushed on up to the crest
there i found a seat of some yellow metal that i did not recognise corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins heads i sat down on it and i surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day it was as sweet and fair a view as i have ever seen the sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson below was the valley of the thames in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel i have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery some in ruins and some still occupied here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk there were no hedges no signs of proprietary rights no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden
so watching i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen and as it shaped itself to me that evening my interpretation was something in this way (afterwards i found i had got only a half truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth)
it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind for the first time i began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged and yet come to think it is a logical consequence enough strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness the work of ameliorating the conditions of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more secure—had gone steadily on to a climax one triumph of a united humanity over nature had followed another things that are now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward and the harvest was what i saw
after all the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in the rudimentary stage the science of our time has attacked but a little department of the field of human disease but even so it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as they can we improve our favourite plants and animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach now a seedless grape now a sweeter and larger flower now a more convenient breed of cattle we improve them gradually because our ideals are vague and tentative and our knowledge is very limited; because nature too is shy and slow in our clumsy hands some day all this will be better organised and still better that is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies the whole world will be intelligent educated and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of nature in the end wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit our human needs
this adjustment i say must have been done and done well; done indeed for all time in the space of time across which my machine had leapt the air was free from gnats the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither the ideal of preventive medicine was attained diseases had been stamped out i saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay and i shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes
social triumphs too had been effected i saw mankind housed in splendid shelters gloriously clothed and as yet i had found them engaged in no toil there were no signs of struggle neither social nor economical struggle the shop the advertisement traffic all that commerce which constitutes the body of our world was gone it was natural on that golden evening that i should jump at the idea of a social paradise the difficulty of increasing population had been met i guessed and population had ceased to increase
but with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change what unless biological science is a mass of errors is the cause of human intelligence and vigour? hardship and freedom: conditions under which the active strong and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men upon self-restraint patience and decision and the institution of the family and the emotions that arise therein the fierce jealousy the tenderness for offspring parental self-devotion all found their justification and support in the imminent dangers of the young _now_ where are these imminent dangers? there is a sentiment arising and it will grow against connubial jealousy against fierce maternity against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things now and things that make us uncomfortable savage survivals discords in a refined and pleasant life
i thought of the physical slightness of the people their lack of intelligence and those big abundant ruins and it strengthened my belief in a perfect conquest of nature for after the battle comes quiet humanity had been strong energetic and intelligent and had used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived and now came the reaction of the altered conditions
under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security that restless energy that with us is strength would become weakness even in our own time certain tendencies and desires once necessary to survival are a constant source of failure physical courage and the love of battle for instance are no great help—may even be hindrances—to a civilised man and in a state of physical balance and security power intellectual as well as physical would be out of place for countless years i judged there had been no danger of war or solitary violence no danger from wild beasts no wasting disease to require strength of constitution no need of toil for such a life what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong are indeed no longer weak better equipped indeed they are for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet no doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings i saw was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace this has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism and then come languor and decay
even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in the time i saw to adorn themselves with flowers to dance to sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit and no more even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity we are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity and it seemed to me that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last
as i stood there in the gathering dark i thought that in this simple explanation i had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole secret of these delicious people possibly the checks they had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary that would account for the abandoned ruins very simple was my explanation and plausible enough—as most wrong theories are
vii a sudden shock as i stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man the full moon yellow and gibbous came up out of an overflow of silver light in the north-east the bright little figures ceased to move about below a noiseless owl flitted by and i shivered with the chill of the night i determined to descend and find where i could sleep
i looked for the building i knew then my eye travelled along to the figure of the white sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze growing distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter i could see the silver birch against it there was the tangle of rhododendron bushes black in the pale light and there was the little lawn i looked at the lawn again a queer doubt chilled my complacency no said i stoutly to myself that was not the lawn
but it _was_ the lawn for the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it can you imagine what i felt as this conviction came home to me? but you cannot the time machine was gone
at once like a lash across the face came the possibility of losing my own age of being left helpless in this strange new world the bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation i could feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing in another moment i was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope once i fell headlong and cut my face; i lost no time in stanching the blood but jumped up and ran on with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin all the time i ran i was saying to myself: they have moved it a little pushed it under the bushes out of the way nevertheless i ran with all my might all the time with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread i knew that such assurance was folly knew instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach my breath came with pain i suppose i covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the little lawn two miles perhaps in ten minutes and i am not a young man i cursed aloud as i ran at my confident folly in leaving the machine wasting good breath thereby i cried aloud and none answered not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world
when i reached the lawn my worst fears were realised not a trace of the thing was to be seen i felt faint and cold when i faced the empty space among the black tangle of bushes i ran round it furiously as if the thing might be hidden in a corner and then stopped abruptly with my hands clutching my hair above me towered the sphinx upon the bronze pedestal white shining leprous in the light of the rising moon it seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay
i might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the mechanism in some shelter for me had i not felt assured of their physical and intellectual inadequacy that is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power through whose intervention my invention had vanished yet for one thing i felt assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate the machine could not have moved in time the attachment of the levers—i will show you the method later—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they were removed it had moved and was hid only in space but then where could it be?
i think i must have had a kind of frenzy i remember running violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx and startling some white animal that in the dim light i took for a small deer i remember too late that night beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs then sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind i went down to the great building of stone the big hall was dark silent and deserted i slipped on the uneven floor and fell over one of the malachite tables almost breaking my shin i lit a match and went on past the dusty curtains of which i have told you
there i found a second great hall covered with cushions upon which perhaps a score or so of the little people were sleeping i have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match for they had forgotten about matches where is my time machine? i began bawling like an angry child laying hands upon them and shaking them up together it must have been very queer to them some laughed most of them looked sorely frightened when i saw them standing round me it came into my head that i was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances in trying to revive the sensation of fear for reasoning from their daylight behaviour i thought that fear must be forgotten
abruptly i dashed down the match and knocking one of the people over in my course went blundering across the big dining-hall again out under the moonlight i heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumbling this way and that i do not remember all i did as the moon crept up the sky i suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me i felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a strange animal in an unknown world i must have raved to and fro screaming and crying upon god and fate i have a memory of horrible fatigue as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength i had nothing left but misery then i slept and when i woke again it was full day and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm
i sat up in the freshness of the morning trying to remember how i had got there and why i had such a profound sense of desertion and despair then things came clear in my mind with the plain reasonable daylight i could look my circumstances fairly in the face i saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight and i could reason with myself suppose the worst? i said suppose the machine altogether lost—perhaps destroyed? it behoves me to be calm and patient to learn the way of the people to get a clear idea of the method of my loss and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end perhaps i may make another that would be my only hope a poor hope perhaps but better than despair and after all it was a beautiful and curious world
but probably the machine had only been taken away still i must be calm and patient find its hiding-place and recover it by force or cunning and with that i scrambled to my feet and looked about me wondering where i could bathe i felt weary stiff and travel-soiled the freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness i had exhausted my emotion indeed as i went about my business i found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight i made a careful examination of the ground about the little lawn i wasted some time in futile questionings conveyed as well as i was able to such of the little people as came by they all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid some thought it was a jest and laughed at me i had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces it was a foolish impulse but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity the turf gave better counsel i found a groove ripped in it about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where on arrival i had struggled with the overturned machine there were other signs of removal about with queer narrow footprints like those i could imagine made by a sloth this directed my closer attention to the pedestal it was as i think i have said of bronze it was not a mere block but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side i went and rapped at these the pedestal was hollow examining the panels with care i found them discontinuous with the frames there were no handles or keyholes but possibly the panels if they were doors as i supposed opened from within one thing was clear enough to my mind it took no very great mental effort to infer that my time machine was inside that pedestal but how it got there was a different problem
i saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me i turned smiling to them and beckoned them to me they came and then pointing to the bronze pedestal i tried to intimate my wish to open it but at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly i dont know how to convey their expression to you suppose you were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look they went off as if they had received the last possible insult i tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next with exactly the same result somehow his manner made me feel ashamed of myself but as you know i wanted the time machine and i tried him once more as he turned off like the others my temper got the better of me in three strides i was after him had him by the loose part of his robe round the neck and began dragging him towards the sphinx then i saw the horror and repugnance of his face and all of a sudden i let him go
but i was not beaten yet i banged with my fist at the bronze panels i thought i heard something stir inside—to be explicit i thought i heard a sound like a chuckle—but i must have been mistaken then i got a big pebble from the river and came and hammered till i had flattened a coil in the decorations and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes the delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand but nothing came of it i saw a crowd of them upon the slopes looking furtively at me at last hot and tired i sat down to watch the place but i was too restless to watch long; i am too occidental for a long vigil i could work at a problem for years but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is another matter
i got up after a time and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towards the hill again patience said i to myself if you want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone if they mean to take your machine away its little good your wrecking their bronze panels and if they dont you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it to sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless that way lies monomania face this world learn its ways watch it be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning in the end you will find clues to it all then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought of the years i had spent in study and toil to get into the future age and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it i had made myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised although it was at my own expense i could not help myself i laughed aloud
going through the big palace it seemed to me that the little people avoided me it may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze yet i felt tolerably sure of the avoidance i was careful however to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing i made what progress i could in the language and in addition i pushed my explorations here and there either i missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs there seemed to be few if any abstract terms or little use of figurative language their sentences were usually simple and of two words and i failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions i determined to put the thought of my time machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way yet a certain feeling you may understand tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival
viii explanation so far as i could see all the world displayed the same exuberant richness as the thames valley from every hill i climbed i saw the same abundance of splendid buildings endlessly varied in material and style the same clustering thickets of evergreens the same blossom-laden trees and tree ferns here and there water shone like silver and beyond the land rose into blue undulating hills and so faded into the serenity of the sky a peculiar feature which presently attracted my attention was the presence of certain circular wells several as it seemed to me of a very great depth one lay by the path up the hill which i had followed during my first walk like the others it was rimmed with bronze curiously wrought and protected by a little cupola from the rain sitting by the side of these wells and peering down into the shafted darkness i could see no gleam of water nor could i start any reflection with a lighted match but in all of them i heard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud like the beating of some big engine; and i discovered from the flaring of my matches that a steady current of air set down the shafts further i threw a scrap of paper into the throat of one and instead of fluttering slowly down it was at once sucked swiftly out of sight
after a time too i came to connect these wells with tall towers standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach putting things together i reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation whose true import it was difficult to imagine i was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people it was an obvious conclusion but it was absolutely wrong
and here i must admit that i learnt very little of drains and bells and modes of conveyance and the like conveniences during my time in this real future in some of these visions of utopias and coming times which i have read there is a vast amount of detail about building and social arrangements and so forth but while such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in ones imagination they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as i found here conceive the tale of london which a negro fresh from central africa would take back to his tribe what would he know of railway companies of social movements of telephone and telegraph wires of the parcels delivery company and postal orders and the like? yet we at least should be willing enough to explain these things to him and even of what he knew how much could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? then think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times and how wide the interval between myself and these of the golden age i was sensible of much which was unseen and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general impression of automatic organisation i fear i can convey very little of the difference to your mind
in the matter of sepulture for instance i could see no signs of crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs but it occurred to me that possibly there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings this again was a question i deliberately put to myself and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point the thing puzzled me and i was led to make a further remark which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were none
i must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure yet i could think of no other let me put my difficulties the several big palaces i had explored were mere living places great dining-halls and sleeping apartments i could find no machinery no appliances of any kind yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal and their sandals though undecorated were fairly complex specimens of metalwork somehow such things must be made and the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency there were no shops no workshops no sign of importations among them they spent all their time in playing gently in bathing in the river in making love in a half-playful fashion in eating fruit and sleeping i could not see how things were kept going
then again about the time machine: something i knew not what had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the white sphinx _why?_ for the life of me i could not imagine those waterless wells too those flickering pillars i felt i lacked a clue i felt—how shall i put it? suppose you found an inscription with sentences here and there in excellent plain english and interpolated therewith others made up of words of letters even absolutely unknown to you? well on the third day of my visit that was how the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one presented itself to me
that day too i made a friend—of a sort it happened that as i was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream the main current ran rather swiftly but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer it will give you an idea therefore of the strange deficiency in these creatures when i tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their eyes when i realised this i hurriedly slipped off my clothes and wading in at a point lower down i caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land a little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round and i had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before i left her i had got to such a low estimate of her kind that i did not expect any gratitude from her in that however i was wrong
this happened in the morning in the afternoon i met my little woman as i believe it was as i was returning towards my centre from an exploration and she received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone the thing took my imagination very possibly i had been feeling desolate at any rate i did my best to display my appreciation of the gift we were soon seated together in a little stone arbour engaged in conversation chiefly of smiles the creatures friendliness affected me exactly as a childs might have done we passed each other flowers and she kissed my hands i did the same to hers then i tried talk and found that her name was weena which though i dont know what it meant somehow seemed appropriate enough that was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted a week and ended—as i will tell you
she was exactly like a child she wanted to be with me always she tried to follow me everywhere and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down and leave her at last exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively but the problems of the world had to be mastered i had not i said to myself come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation yet her distress when i left her was very great her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic and i think altogether i had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion nevertheless she was somehow a very great comfort i thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me until it was too late i did not clearly know what i had inflicted upon her when i left her nor until it was too late did i clearly understand what she was to me for by merely seeming fond of me and showing in her weak futile way that she cared for me the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the white sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and i would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as i came over the hill
it was from her too that i learnt that fear had not yet left the world she was fearless enough in the daylight and she had the oddest confidence in me; for once in a foolish moment i made threatening grimaces at her and she simply laughed at them but she dreaded the dark dreaded shadows dreaded black things darkness to her was the one thing dreadful it was a singularly passionate emotion and it set me thinking and observing i discovered then among other things that these little people gathered into the great houses after dark and slept in droves to enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension i never found one out of doors or one sleeping alone within doors after dark yet i was still such a blockhead that i missed the lesson of that fear and in spite of weenas distress i insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering multitudes
it troubled her greatly but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed and for five of the nights of our acquaintance including the last night of all she slept with her head pillowed on my arm but my story slips away from me as i speak of her it must have been the night before her rescue that i was awakened about dawn i had been restless dreaming most disagreeably that i was drowned and that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps i woke with a start and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the chamber i tried to get to sleep again but i felt restless and uncomfortable it was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness when everything is colourless and clear cut and yet unreal i got up and went down into the great hall and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace i thought i would make a virtue of necessity and see the sunrise
the moon was setting and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light the bushes were inky black the ground a sombre grey the sky colourless and cheerless and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts three several times as i scanned the slope i saw white figures twice i fancied i saw a solitary white ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body they moved hastily i did not see what became of them it seemed that they vanished among the bushes the dawn was still indistinct you must understand i was feeling that chill uncertain early-morning feeling you may have known i doubted my eyes
as the eastern sky grew brighter and the light of the day came on and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more i scanned the view keenly but i saw no vestige of my white figures they were mere creatures of the half-light they must have been ghosts i said; i wonder whence they dated for a queer notion of grant allens came into my head and amused me if each generation die and leave ghosts he argued the world at last will get overcrowded with them on that theory they would have grown innumerable some eight hundred thousand years hence and it was no great wonder to see four at once but the jest was unsatisfying and i was thinking of these figures all the morning until weenas rescue drove them out of my head i associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal i had startled in my first passionate search for the time machine but weena was a pleasant substitute yet all the same they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind
i think i have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this golden age i cannot account for it it may be that the sun was hotter or the earth nearer the sun it is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future but people unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger darwin forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body as these catastrophes occur the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate whatever the reason the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it
well one very hot morning—my fourth i think—as i was seeking shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where i slept and fed there happened this strange thing clambering among these heaps of masonry i found a narrow gallery whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone by contrast with the brilliancy outside it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me i entered it groping for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me suddenly i halted spellbound a pair of eyes luminous by reflection against the daylight without was watching me out of the darkness
the old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me i clenched my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs i was afraid to turn then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came to my mind and then i remembered that strange terror of the dark overcoming my fear to some extent i advanced a step and spoke i will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-controlled i put out my hand and touched something soft at once the eyes darted sideways and something white ran past me i turned with my heart in my mouth and saw a queer little ape-like figure its head held down in a peculiar manner running across the sunlit space behind me it blundered against a block of granite staggered aside and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry
my impression of it is of course imperfect; but i know it was a dull white and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on its head and down its back but as i say it went too fast for me to see distinctly i cannot even say whether it ran on all fours or only with its forearms held very low after an instants pause i followed it into the second heap of ruins i could not find it at first; but after a time in the profound obscurity i came upon one of those round well-like openings of which i have told you half closed by a fallen pillar a sudden thought came to me could this thing have vanished down the shaft? i lit a match and looking down i saw a small white moving creature with large bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated it made me shudder it was so like a human spider it was clambering down the wall and now i saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand going out as it dropped and when i had lit another the little monster had disappeared
i do not know how long i sat peering down that well it was not for some time that i could succeed in persuading myself that the thing i had seen was human but gradually the truth dawned on me: that man had not remained one species but had differentiated into two distinct animals: that my graceful children of the upper world were not the sole descendants of our generation but that this bleached obscene nocturnal thing which had flashed before me was also heir to all the ages
i thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground ventilation i began to suspect their true import and what i wondered was this lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organisation? how was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful overworlders? and what was hidden down there at the foot of that shaft? i sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that at any rate there was nothing to fear and that there i must descend for the solution of my difficulties and withal i was absolutely afraid to go as i hesitated two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow the male pursued the female flinging flowers at her as he ran
they seemed distressed to find me my arm against the overturned pillar peering down the well apparently it was considered bad form to remark these apertures; for when i pointed to this one and tried to frame a question about it in their tongue they were still more visibly distressed and turned away but they were interested by my matches and i struck some to amuse them i tried them again about the well and again i failed so presently i left them meaning to go back to weena and see what i could get from her but my mind was already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment i had now a clue to the import of these wells to the ventilating towers to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the time machine and very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me
here was the new view plainly this second species of man was subterranean there were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground habit in the first place there was the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the white fish of the kentucky caves for instance then those large eyes with that capacity for reflecting light are common features of nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat and last of all that evident confusion in the sunshine that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina
beneath my feet then the earth must be tunnelled enormously and these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race the presence of ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere in fact except along the river valley—showed how universal were its ramifications what so natural then as to assume that it was in this artificial underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done? the notion was so plausible that i at once accepted it and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the human species i dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory; though for myself i very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth
at first proceeding from the problems of our own age it seemed clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary and social difference between the capitalist and the labourer was the key to the whole position no doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you—and wildly incredible—and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way there is a tendency to utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there is the metropolitan railway in london for instance there are new electric railways there are subways there are underground workrooms and restaurants and they increase and multiply evidently i thought this tendency had increased till industry had gradually lost its birthright in the sky i mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein till in the end— even now does not an east-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth?
again the exclusive tendency of richer people—due no doubt to the increasing refinement of their education and the widening gulf between them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the closing in their interest of considerable portions of the surface of the land about london for instance perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion and this same widening gulf—which is due to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class that promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social stratification less and less frequent so in the end above ground you must have the haves pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty and below ground the have-nots the workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of their labour once they were there they would no doubt have to pay rent and not a little of it for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused they would starve or be suffocated for arrears such of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and in the end the balance being permanent the survivors would become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life and as happy in their way as the overworld people were to theirs as it seemed to me the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally enough
the great triumph of humanity i had dreamed of took a different shape in my mind it had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation as i had imagined instead i saw a real aristocracy armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of today its triumph had not been simply a triumph over nature but a triumph over nature and the fellow-man this i must warn you was my theory at the time i had no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the utopian books my explanation may be absolutely wrong i still think it is the most plausible one but even on this supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed its zenith and was now far fallen into decay the too-perfect security of the overworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration to a general dwindling in size strength and intelligence that i could see clearly enough already what had happened to the undergrounders i did not yet suspect; but from what i had seen of the morlocks—that by the bye was the name by which these creatures were called—i could imagine that the modification of the human type was even far more profound than among the eloi the beautiful race that i already knew
then came troublesome doubts why had the morlocks taken my time machine? for i felt sure it was they who had taken it why too if the eloi were masters could they not restore the machine to me? and why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? i proceeded as i have said to question weena about this underworld but here again i was disappointed at first she would not understand my questions and presently she refused to answer them she shivered as though the topic was unendurable and when i pressed her perhaps a little harshly she burst into tears they were the only tears except my own i ever saw in that golden age when i saw them i ceased abruptly to trouble about the morlocks and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her human inheritance from weenas eyes and very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands while i solemnly burnt a match
ix the morlocks it may seem odd to you but it was two days before i could follow up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way i felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies they were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum and they were filthily cold to the touch probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the eloi whose disgust of the morlocks i now began to appreciate
the next night i did not sleep well probably my health was a little disordered i was oppressed with perplexity and doubt once or twice i had a feeling of intense fear for which i could perceive no definite reason i remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night weena was among them—and feeling reassured by their presence it occurred to me even then that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter and the nights grow dark when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below these whitened lemurs this new vermin that had replaced the old might be more abundant and on both these days i had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty i felt assured that the time machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these mysteries of underground yet i could not face the mystery if only i had had a companion it would have been different but i was so horribly alone and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me i dont know if you will understand my feeling but i never felt quite safe at my back
it was this restlessness this insecurity perhaps that drove me farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions going to the south-westward towards the rising country that is now called combe wood i observed far-off in the direction of nineteenth-century banstead a vast green structure different in character from any i had hitherto seen it was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins i knew and the façade had an oriental look: the face of it having the lustre as well as the pale-green tint a kind of bluish-green of a certain type of chinese porcelain this difference in aspect suggested a difference in use and i was minded to push on and explore but the day was growing late and i had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so i resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day and i returned to the welcome and the caresses of little weena but next morning i perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the palace of green porcelain was a piece of self-deception to enable me to shirk by another day an experience i dreaded i resolved i would make the descent without further waste of time and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium
little weena ran with me she danced beside me to the well but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward she seemed strangely disconcerted good-bye little weena i said kissing her; and then putting her down i began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks rather hastily i may as well confess for i feared my courage might leak away at first she watched me in amazement then she gave a most piteous cry and running to me she began to pull at me with her little hands i think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed i shook her off perhaps a little roughly and in another moment i was in the throat of the well i saw her agonised face over the parapet and smiled to reassure her then i had to look down at the unstable hooks to which i clung
i had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards the descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself i was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent and not simply fatigued one of the bars bent suddenly under my weight and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath for a moment i hung by one hand and after that experience i did not dare to rest again though my arms and back were presently acutely painful i went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible glancing upward i saw the aperture a small blue disc in which a star was visible while little weenas head showed as a round black projection the thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive everything save that little disc above was profoundly dark and when i looked up again weena had disappeared
i was in an agony of discomfort i had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again and leave the underworld alone but even while i turned this over in my mind i continued to descend at last with intense relief i saw dimly coming up a foot to the right of me a slender loophole in the wall swinging myself in i found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which i could lie down and rest it was not too soon my arms ached my back was cramped and i was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall besides this the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes the air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft
i do not know how long i lay i was arroused by a soft hand touching my face starting up in the darkness i snatched at my matches and hastily striking one i saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one i had seen above ground in the ruin hastily retreating before the light living as they did in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes and they reflected the light in the same way i have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light but so soon as i struck a match in order to see them they fled incontinently vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion
i tried to call to them but the language they had was apparently different from that of the overworld people; so that i was needs left to my own unaided efforts and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind but i said to myself you are in for it now and feeling my way along the tunnel i found the noise of machinery grow louder presently the walls fell away from me and i came to a large open space and striking another match saw that i had entered a vast arched cavern which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light the view i had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match
necessarily my memory is vague great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness and cast grotesque black shadows in which dim spectral morlocks sheltered from the glare the place by the bye was very stuffy and oppressive and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood was in the air some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal laid with what seemed a meal the morlocks at any rate were carnivorous even at the time i remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint i saw it was all very indistinct: the heavy smell the big unmeaning shapes the obscene figures lurking in the shadows and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again then the match burnt down and stung my fingers and fell a wriggling red spot in the blackness
i have thought since how particularly ill-equipped i was for such an experience when i had started with the time machine i had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances i had come without arms without medicine without anything to smoke—at times i missed tobacco frightfully—even without enough matches if only i had thought of a kodak i could have flashed that glimpse of the underworld in a second and examined it at leisure but as it was i stood there with only the weapons and the powers that nature had endowed me with—hands feet and teeth; these and four safety-matches that still remained to me
i was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark and it was only with my last glimpse of light i discovered that my store of matches had run low it had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economise them and i had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the overworlders to whom fire was a novelty now as i say i had four left and while i stood in the dark a hand touched mine lank fingers came feeling over my face and i was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour i fancied i heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me i felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing the sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant the sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness i shouted at them as loudly as i could they started away and then i could feel them approaching me again they clutched at me more boldly whispering odd sounds to each other i shivered violently and shouted again—rather discordantly this time they were not so seriously alarmed and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me i will confess i was horribly frightened i determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare i did so and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket i made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel but i had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness i could hear the morlocks rustling like wind among leaves and pattering like the rain as they hurried after me
in a moment i was clutched by several hands and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back i struck another light and waved it in their dazzled faces you can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale chinless faces and great lidless pinkish-grey eyes—as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment but i did not stay to look i promise you: i retreated again and when my second match had ended i struck my third it had almost burnt through when i reached the opening into the shaft i lay down on the edge for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy then i felt sideways for the projecting hooks and as i did so my feet were grasped from behind and i was violently tugged backward i lit my last match … and it incontinently went out but i had my hand on the climbing bars now and kicking violently i disengaged myself from the clutches of the morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy
that climb seemed interminable to me with the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me i had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold the last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness several times my head swam and i felt all the sensations of falling at last however i got over the well-mouth somehow and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight i fell upon my face even the soil smelt sweet and clean then i remember weena kissing my hands and ears and the voices of others among the eloi then for a time i was insensible
x when night came now indeed i seemed in a worse case than before hitherto except during my nights anguish at the loss of the time machine i had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries hitherto i had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people and by some unknown forces which i had only to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the morlocks—a something inhuman and malign instinctively i loathed them before i had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it now i felt like a beast in a trap whose enemy would come upon him soon
the enemy i dreaded may surprise you it was the darkness of the new moon weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the dark nights it was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming dark nights might mean the moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness and i now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little upperworld people for the dark i wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the morlocks did under the new moon i felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong the upperworld people might once have been the favoured aristocracy and the morlocks their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away the two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards or had already arrived at an altogether new relationship the eloi like the carlovignan kings had decayed to a mere beautiful futility they still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the morlocks subterranean for innumerable generations had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable and the morlocks made their garments i inferred and maintained them in their habitual needs perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service they did it as a standing horse paws with his foot or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism but clearly the old order was already in part reversed the nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace ages ago thousands of generations ago man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine and now that brother was coming back—changed already the eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew they were becoming reacquainted with fear and suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat i had seen in the underworld it seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations but coming in almost like a question from outside i tried to recall the form of it i had a vague sense of something familiar but i could not tell what it was at the time
still however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious fear i was differently constituted i came out of this age of ours this ripe prime of the human race when fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors i at least would defend myself without further delay i determined to make myself arms and a fastness where i might sleep with that refuge as a base i could face this strange world with some of that confidence i had lost in realising to what creatures night by night i lay exposed i felt i could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them i shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me
i wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the thames but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible all the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the morlocks to judge by their wells must be then the tall pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening taking weena like a child upon my shoulder i went up the hills towards the south-west the distance i had reckoned was seven or eight miles but it must have been nearer eighteen i had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished in addition the heel of one of my shoes was loose and a nail was working through the sole—they were comfortable old shoes i wore about indoors—so that i was lame and it was already long past sunset when i came in sight of the palace silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky
weena had been hugely delighted when i began to carry her but after a while she desired me to let her down and ran along by the side of me occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets my pockets had always puzzled weena but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral decoration at least she utilised them for that purpose and that reminds me in changing my jacket i found…
_the time traveller paused put his hand into his pocket and silently placed two withered flowers not unlike very large white mallows upon the little table then he resumed his narrative_
as the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards wimbledon weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone but i pointed out the distant pinnacles of the palace of green porcelain to her and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her fear you know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? even the breeze stops in the trees to me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness the sky was clear remote and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset well that night the expectation took the colour of my fears in that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened i fancied i could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could indeed almost see through it the morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark in my excitement i fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war and why had they taken my time machine?
so we went on in the quiet and the twilight deepened into night the clear blue of the distance faded and one star after another came out the ground grew dim and the trees black weenas fears and her fatigue grew upon her i took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her then as the darkness grew deeper she put her arms round my neck and closing her eyes tightly pressed her face against my shoulder so we went down a long slope into a valley and there in the dimness i almost walked into a little river this i waded and went up the opposite side of the valley past a number of sleeping houses and by a statue—a faun or some such figure _minus_ the head here too were acacias so far i had seen nothing of the morlocks but it was yet early in the night and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come
from the brow of the next hill i saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me i hesitated at this i could see no end to it either to the right or the left feeling tired—my feet in particular were very sore—i carefully lowered weena from my shoulder as i halted and sat down upon the turf i could no longer see the palace of green porcelain and i was in doubt of my direction i looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars even were there no other lurking danger—a danger i did not care to let my imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against i was very tired too after the excitements of the day; so i decided that i would not face it but would pass the night upon the open hill
weena i was glad to find was fast asleep i carefully wrapped her in my jacket and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise the hillside was quiet and deserted but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things above me shone the stars for the night was very clear i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling all the old constellations had gone from the sky however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings but the milky way it seemed to me was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore southward (as i judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green sirius and amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend
looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life i thought of their unfathomable distance and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future i thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that i had traversed and during these few revolutions all the activity all the traditions the complex organisations the nations languages literatures aspirations even the mere memory of man as i knew him had been swept out of existence instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry and the white things of which i went in terror then i thought of the great fear that was between the two species and for the first time with a sudden shiver came the clear knowledge of what the meat i had seen might be yet it was too horrible i looked at little weena sleeping beside me her face white and starlike under the stars and forthwith dismissed the thought
through that long night i held my mind off the morlocks as well as i could and whiled away the time by trying to fancy i could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion the sky kept very clear except for a hazy cloud or so no doubt i dozed at times then as my vigil wore on came a faintness in the eastward sky like the reflection of some colourless fire and the old moon rose thin and peaked and white and close behind and overtaking it and overflowing it the dawn came pale at first and then growing pink and warm no morlocks had approached us indeed i had seen none upon the hill that night and in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable i stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so i sat down again took off my shoes and flung them away
i awakened weena and we went down into the wood now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding we found some fruit wherewith to break our fast we soon met others of the dainty ones laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen i felt assured now of what it was and from the bottom of my heart i pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity clearly at some time in the long-ago of human decay the morlocks food had run short possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was—far less than any monkey his prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct and so these inhuman sons of men—— i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit after all they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago and the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone why should i trouble myself? these eloi were mere fatted cattle which the ant-like morlocks preserved and preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of and there was weena dancing at my side
then i tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man had taken necessity as his watchword and excuse and in the fullness of time necessity had come home to him i even tried a carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay but this attitude of mind was impossible however great their intellectual degradation the eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their fear
i had at that time very vague ideas as to the course i should pursue my first was to secure some safe place of refuge and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as i could contrive that necessity was immediate in the next place i hoped to procure some means of fire so that i should have the weapon of a torch at hand for nothing i knew would be more efficient against these morlocks then i wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the white sphinx i had in mind a battering ram i had a persuasion that if i could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me i should discover the time machine and escape i could not imagine the morlocks were strong enough to move it far away weena i had resolved to bring with me to our own time and turning such schemes over in my mind i pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling
xi the palace of green porcelain
i found the palace of green porcelain when we approached it about noon deserted and falling into ruin only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework it lay very high upon a turfy down and looking north-eastward before i entered it i was surprised to see a large estuary or even creek where i judged wandsworth and battersea must once have been i thought then—though i never followed up the thought—of what might have happened or might be happening to the living things in the sea
the material of the palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain and along the face of it i saw an inscription in some unknown character i thought rather foolishly that weena might help me to interpret this but i only learnt that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head she always seemed to me i fancy more human than she was perhaps because her affection was so human
within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found instead of the customary hall a long gallery lit by many side windows at the first glance i was reminded of a museum the tiled floor was thick with dust and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering then i perceived standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton i recognised by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the megatherium the skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust and in one place where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof the thing itself had been worn away further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a brontosaurus my museum hypothesis was confirmed going towards the side i found what appeared to be sloping shelves and clearing away the thick dust i found the old familiar glass cases of our own time but they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents
clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day south kensington here apparently was the palæontological section and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time and had through the extinction of bacteria and fungi lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force was nevertheless with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures here and there i found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds and the cases had in some instances been bodily removed—by the morlocks as i judged the place was very silent the thick dust deadened our footsteps weena who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case presently came as i stared about me and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me
and at first i was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age that i gave no thought to the possibilities it presented even my preoccupation about the time machine receded a little from my mind
to judge from the size of the place this palace of green porcelain had a great deal more in it than a gallery of palæontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be even a library to me at least in my present circumstances these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology in decay exploring i found another short gallery running transversely to the first this appeared to be devoted to minerals and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder but i could find no saltpetre; indeed no nitrates of any kind doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago yet the sulphur hung in my mind and set up a train of thinking as for the rest of the contents of that gallery though on the whole they were the best preserved of all i saw i had little interest i am no specialist in mineralogy and i went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall i had entered apparently this section had been devoted to natural history but everything had long since passed out of recognition a few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit a brown dust of departed plants: that was all i was sorry for that because i should have been glad to trace the patient readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions but singularly ill-lit the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which i entered at intervals white globes hung from the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit here i was more in my element for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines all greatly corroded and many broken down but some still fairly complete you know i have a certain weakness for mechanism and i was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles and i could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for i fancied that if i could solve their puzzles i should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the morlocks
suddenly weena came very close to my side so suddenly that she startled me had it not been for her i do not think i should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all [footnote: it may be of course that the floor did not slope but that the museum was built into the side of a hill—ed] the end i had come in at was quite above ground and was lit by rare slit-like windows as you went down the length the ground came up against these windows until at last there was a pit like the area of a london house before each and only a narrow line of daylight at the top i went slowly along puzzling about the machines and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light until weenas increasing apprehensions drew my attention then i saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness i hesitated and then as i looked round me i saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even further away towards the dimness it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints my sense of the immediate presence of the morlocks revived at that i felt that i was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery i called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon and that i had still no weapon no refuge and no means of making a fire and then down in the remote blackness of the gallery i heard a peculiar pattering and the same odd noises i had heard down the well
i took weenas hand then struck with a sudden idea i left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box clambering upon the stand and grasping this lever in my hands i put all my weight upon it sideways suddenly weena deserted in the central aisle began to whimper i had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly for it snapped after a minutes strain and i rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient i judged for any morlock skull i might encounter and i longed very much to kill a morlock or so very inhuman you may think to want to go killing ones own descendants but it was impossible somehow to feel any humanity in the things only my disinclination to leave weena and a persuasion that if i began to slake my thirst for murder my time machine might suffer restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes i heard
well mace in one hand and weena in the other i went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags the brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it i presently recognised as the decaying vestiges of books they had long since dropped to pieces and every semblance of print had left them but here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough had i been a literary man i might perhaps have moralised upon the futility of all ambition but as it was the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified at the time i will confess that i thought chiefly of the _philosophical transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics
then going up a broad staircase we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry and here i had not a little hope of useful discoveries except at one end where the roof had collapsed this gallery was well preserved i went eagerly to every unbroken case and at last in one of the really air-tight cases i found a box of matches very eagerly i tried them they were perfectly good they were not even damp i turned to weena dance i cried to her in her own tongue for now i had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared and so in that derelict museum upon the thick soft carpeting of dust to weenas huge delight i solemnly performed a kind of composite dance whistling _the land of the leal_ as cheerfully as i could in part it was a modest _cancan_ in part a step dance in part a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted) and in part original for i am naturally inventive as you know
now i still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange as for me it was a most fortunate thing yet oddly enough i found a far unlikelier substance and that was camphor i found it in a sealed jar that by chance i suppose had been really hermetically sealed i fancied at first that it was paraffin wax and smashed the glass accordingly but the odour of camphor was unmistakable in the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive perhaps through many thousands of centuries it reminded me of a sepia painting i had once seen done from the ink of a fossil belemnite that must have perished and become fossilised millions of years ago i was about to throw it away but i remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame—was in fact an excellent candle—and i put it in my pocket i found no explosives however nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors as yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing i had chanced upon nevertheless i left that gallery greatly elated
i cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon it would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order i remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms and how i hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword i could not carry both however and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates there were numbers of guns pistols and rifles the most were masses of rust but many were of some new metal and still fairly sound but any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust one corner i saw was charred and shattered; perhaps i thought by an explosion among the specimens in another place was a vast array of idols—polynesian mexican grecian phœnician every country on earth i should think and here yielding to an irresistible impulse i wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from south america that particularly took my fancy
as the evening drew on my interest waned i went through gallery after gallery dusty silent often ruinous the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite sometimes fresher in one place i suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine and then by the merest accident i discovered in an air-tight case two dynamite cartridges i shouted eureka and smashed the case with joy then came a doubt i hesitated then selecting a little side gallery i made my essay i never felt such a disappointment as i did in waiting five ten fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came of course the things were dummies as i might have guessed from their presence i really believe that had they not been so i should have rushed off incontinently and blown sphinx bronze doors and (as it proved) my chances of finding the time machine all together into non-existence
it was after that i think that we came to a little open court within the palace it was turfed and had three fruit-trees so we rested and refreshed ourselves towards sunset i began to consider our position night was creeping upon us and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found but that troubled me very little now i had in my possession a thing that was perhaps the best of all defences against the morlocks—i had matches i had the camphor in my pocket too if a blaze were needed it seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open protected by a fire in the morning there was the getting of the time machine towards that as yet i had only my iron mace but now with my growing knowledge i felt very differently towards those bronze doors up to this i had refrained from forcing them largely because of the mystery on the other side they had never impressed me as being very strong and i hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work
xii in the darkness we emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon i was determined to reach the white sphinx early the next morning and ere the dusk i purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey my plan was to go as far as possible that night and then building a fire to sleep in the protection of its glare accordingly as we went along i gathered any sticks or dried grass i saw and presently had my arms full of such litter thus loaded our progress was slower than i had anticipated and besides weena was tired and i also began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood upon the shrubby hill of its edge weena would have stopped fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity that should indeed have served me as a warning drove me onward i had been without sleep for a night and two days and i was feverish and irritable i felt sleep coming upon me and the morlocks with it
while we hesitated among the black bushes behind us and dim against their blackness i saw three crouching figures there was scrub and long grass all about us and i did not feel safe from their insidious approach the forest i calculated was rather less than a mile across if we could get through it to the bare hillside there as it seemed to me was an altogether safer resting-place; i thought that with my matches and my camphor i could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods yet it was evident that if i was to flourish matches with my hands i should have to abandon my firewood; so rather reluctantly i put it down and then it came into my head that i would amaze our friends behind by lighting it i was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat
i dont know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate the suns heat is rarely strong enough to burn even when it is focused by dewdrops as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts lightning may blast and blacken but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation but this rarely results in flame in this decadence too the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth the red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to weena
she wanted to run to it and play with it i believe she would have cast herself into it had i not restrained her but i caught her up and in spite of her struggles plunged boldly before me into the wood for a little way the glare of my fire lit the path looking back presently i could see through the crowded stems that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill i laughed at that and turned again to the dark trees before me it was very black and weena clung to me convulsively but there was still as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness sufficient light for me to avoid the stems overhead it was simply black except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there i lit none of my matches because i had no hand free upon my left arm i carried my little one in my right hand i had my iron bar
for some way i heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet the faint rustle of the breeze above and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my ears then i seemed to know of a pattering behind me i pushed on grimly the pattering grew more distinct and then i caught the same queer sound and voices i had heard in the underworld there were evidently several of the morlocks and they were closing in upon me indeed in another minute i felt a tug at my coat then something at my arm and weena shivered violently and became quite still
it was time for a match but to get one i must put her down i did so and as i fumbled with my pocket a struggle began in the darkness about my knees perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the morlocks soft little hands too were creeping over my coat and back touching even my neck then the match scratched and fizzed i held it flaring and saw the white backs of the morlocks in flight amid the trees i hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane then i looked at weena she was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless with her face to the ground with a sudden fright i stooped to her she seemed scarcely to breathe i lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground and as it split and flared up and drove back the morlocks and the shadows i knelt down and lifted her the wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company
she seemed to have fainted i put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on and then there came a horrible realisation in manœuvring with my matches and weena i had turned myself about several times and now i had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path for all i knew i might be facing back towards the palace of green porcelain i found myself in a cold sweat i had to think rapidly what to do i determined to build a fire and encamp where we were i put weena still motionless down upon a turfy bole and very hastily as my first lump of camphor waned i began collecting sticks and leaves here and there out of the darkness round me the morlocks eyes shone like carbuncles
the camphor flickered and went out i lit a match and as i did so two white forms that had been approaching weena dashed hastily away one was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and i felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist he gave a whoop of dismay staggered a little way and fell down i lit another piece of camphor and went on gathering my bonfire presently i noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me for since my arrival on the time machine a matter of a week no rain had fallen so instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs i began leaping up and dragging down branches very soon i had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks and could economise my camphor then i turned to where weena lay beside my iron mace i tried what i could to revive her but she lay like one dead i could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed
now the smoke of the fire beat over towards me and it must have made me heavy of a sudden moreover the vapour of camphor was in the air my fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so i felt very weary after my exertion and sat down the wood too was full of a slumbrous murmur that i did not understand i seemed just to nod and open my eyes but all was dark and the morlocks had their hands upon me flinging off their clinging fingers i hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box and—it had gone then they gripped and closed with me again in a moment i knew what had happened i had slept and my fire had gone out and the bitterness of death came over my soul the forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood i was caught by the neck by the hair by the arms and pulled down it was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me i felt as if i was in a monstrous spiders web i was overpowered and went down i felt little teeth nipping at my neck i rolled over and as i did so my hand came against my iron lever it gave me strength i struggled up shaking the human rats from me and holding the bar short i thrust where i judged their faces might be i could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows and for a moment i was free
the strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me i knew that both i and weena were lost but i determined to make the morlocks pay for their meat i stood with my back to a tree swinging the iron bar before me the whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them a minute passed their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement and their movements grew faster yet none came within reach i stood glaring at the blackness then suddenly came hope what if the morlocks were afraid? and close on the heels of that came a strange thing the darkness seemed to grow luminous very dimly i began to see the morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then i recognised with incredulous surprise that the others were running in an incessant stream as it seemed from behind me and away through the wood in front and their backs seemed no longer white but reddish as i stood agape i saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches and vanish and at that i understood the smell of burning wood the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar the red glow and the morlocks flight
stepping out from behind my tree and looking back i saw through the black pillars of the nearer trees the flames of the burning forest it was my first fire coming after me with that i looked for weena but she was gone the hissing and crackling behind me the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame left little time for reflection my iron bar still gripped i followed in the morlocks path it was a close race once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as i ran that i was outflanked and had to strike off to the left but at last i emerged upon a small open space and as i did so a morlock came blundering towards me and past me and went on straight into the fire
and now i was to see the most weird and horrible thing i think of all that i beheld in that future age this whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire in the centre was a hillock or tumulus surmounted by a scorched hawthorn beyond this was another arm of the burning forest with yellow tongues already writhing from it completely encircling the space with a fence of fire upon the hillside were some thirty or forty morlocks dazzled by the light and heat and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment at first i did not realise their blindness and struck furiously at them with my bar in a frenzy of fear as they approached me killing one and crippling several more but when i had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky and heard their moans i was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare and i struck no more of them
yet every now and then one would come straight towards me setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him at one time the flames died down somewhat and i feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me i was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out again brightly and i stayed my hand i walked about the hill among them and avoided them looking for some trace of weena but weena was gone
at last i sat down on the summit of the hillock and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro and making uncanny noises to each other as the glare of the fire beat on them the coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky and through the rare tatters of that red canopy remote as though they belonged to another universe shone the little stars two or three morlocks came blundering into me and i drove them off with blows of my fists trembling as i did so
for the most part of that night i was persuaded it was a nightmare i bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake i beat the ground with my hands and got up and sat down again and wandered here and there and again sat down then i would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon god to let me awake thrice i saw morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames but at last above the subsiding red of the fire above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures came the white light of the day
i searched again for traces of weena but there were none it was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest i cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined as i thought of that i was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me but i contained myself the hillock as i have said was a kind of island in the forest from its summit i could now make out through a haze of smoke the palace of green porcelain and from that i could get my bearings for the white sphinx and so leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning as the day grew clearer i tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with fire towards the hiding-place of the time machine i walked slowly for i was almost exhausted as well as lame and i felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little weena it seemed an overwhelming calamity now in this old familiar room it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss but that morning it left me absolutely lonely again—terribly alone i began to think of this house of mine of this fireside of some of you and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain
but as i walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky i made a discovery in my trouser pocket were still some loose matches the box must have leaked before it was lost
xiii the trap of the white sphinx
about eight or nine in the morning i came to the same seat of yellow metal from which i had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival i thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence here was the same beautiful scene the same abundant foliage the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins the same silver river running between its fertile banks the gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither among the trees some were bathing in exactly the place where i had saved weena and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain and like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the underworld i understood now what all the beauty of the overworld people covered very pleasant was their day as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field like the cattle they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs and their end was the same
i grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been it had committed suicide it had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last once life and property must have reached almost absolute safety the rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort the toiler assured of his life and work no doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem no social question left unsolved and a great quiet had followed
it is a law of nature we overlook that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change danger and trouble an animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless there is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change only those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers
so as i see it the upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness and the underworld to mere mechanical industry but that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection—absolute permanency apparently as time went on the feeding of an underworld however it was effected had become disjointed mother necessity who had been staved off for a few thousand years came back again and she began below the underworld being in contact with machinery which however perfect still needs some little thought outside habit had probably retained perforce rather more initiative if less of every other human character than the upper and when other meat failed them they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden so i say i saw it in my last view of the world of eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred and one it may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent it is how the thing shaped itself to me and as that i give it to you
after the fatigues excitements and terrors of the past days and in spite of my grief this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were very pleasant i was very tired and sleepy and soon my theorising passed into dozing catching myself at that i took my own hint and spreading myself out upon the turf i had a long and refreshing sleep
i awoke a little before sunsetting i now felt safe against being caught napping by the morlocks and stretching myself i came on down the hill towards the white sphinx i had my crowbar in one hand and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket
and now came a most unexpected thing as i approached the pedestal of the sphinx i found the bronze valves were open they had slid down into grooves
at that i stopped short before them hesitating to enter
within was a small apartment and on a raised place in the corner of this was the time machine i had the small levers in my pocket so here after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the white sphinx was a meek surrender i threw my iron bar away almost sorry not to use it
a sudden thought came into my head as i stooped towards the portal for once at least i grasped the mental operations of the morlocks suppressing a strong inclination to laugh i stepped through the bronze frame and up to the time machine i was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned i have suspected since that the morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose
now as i stood and examined it finding a pleasure in the mere touch of the contrivance the thing i had expected happened the bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang i was in the dark—trapped so the morlocks thought at that i chuckled gleefully
i could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me very calmly i tried to strike the match i had only to fix on the levers and depart then like a ghost but i had overlooked one little thing the matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box
you may imagine how all my calm vanished the little brutes were close upon me one touched me i made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine then came one hand upon me and then another then i had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted one indeed they almost got away from me as it slipped from my hand i had to butt in the dark with my head—i could hear the morlocks skull ring—to recover it it was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest i think this last scramble
but at last the lever was fixed and pulled over the clinging hands slipped from me the darkness presently fell from my eyes i found myself in the same grey light and tumult i have already described
xiv the further vision i have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with time travelling and this time i was not seated properly in the saddle but sideways and in an unstable fashion for an indefinite time i clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated quite unheeding how i went and when i brought myself to look at the dials again i was amazed to find where i had arrived one dial records days and another thousands of days another millions of days and another thousands of millions now instead of reversing the levers i had pulled them over so as to go forward with them and when i came to look at these indicators i found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch—into futurity
as i drove on a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things the palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though i was still travelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and night which was usually indicative of a slower pace returned and grew more and more marked this puzzled me very much at first the alternations of night and day grew slower and slower and so did the passage of the sun across the sky until they seemed to stretch through centuries at last a steady twilight brooded over the earth a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky the band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in the west and grew ever broader and more red all trace of the moon had vanished the circling of the stars growing slower and slower had given place to creeping points of light at last some time before i stopped the sun red and very large halted motionless upon the horizon a vast dome glowing with a dull heat and now and then suffering a momentary extinction at one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat i perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done the earth had come to rest with one face to the sun even as in our own time the moon faces the earth very cautiously for i remembered my former headlong fall i began to reverse my motion slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale still slower until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible
i stopped very gently and sat upon the time machine looking round the sky was no longer blue north-eastward it was inky black and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars overhead it was a deep indian red and starless and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where cut by the horizon lay the huge hull of the sun red and motionless the rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour and all the trace of life that i could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face it was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight
the machine was standing on a sloping beach the sea stretched away to the south-west to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky there were no breakers and no waves for not a breath of wind was stirring only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living and along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky there was a sense of oppression in my head and i noticed that i was breathing very fast the sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering and from that i judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now
far away up the desolate slope i heard a harsh scream and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and circling disappear over some low hillocks beyond the sound of its voice was so dismal that i shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine looking round me again i saw that quite near what i had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me then i saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly its big claws swaying its long antennæ like carters whips waving and feeling and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there i could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved
as i stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me i felt a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there i tried to brush it away with my hand but in a moment it returned and almost immediately came another by my ear i struck at this and caught something threadlike it was drawn swiftly out of my hand with a frightful qualm i turned and i saw that i had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks its mouth was all alive with appetite and its vast ungainly claws smeared with an algal slime were descending upon me in a moment my hand was on the lever and i had placed a month between myself and these monsters but i was still on the same beach and i saw them distinctly now as soon as i stopped dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there in the sombre light among the foliated sheets of intense green
i cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world the red eastern sky the northward blackness the salt dead sea the stony beach crawling with these foul slow-stirring monsters the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants the thin air that hurts ones lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect i moved on a hundred years and there was the same red sun—a little larger a little duller—the same dying sea the same chill air and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red rocks and in the westward sky i saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon
so i travelled stopping ever and again in great strides of a thousand years or more drawn on by the mystery of the earths fate watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky and the life of the old earth ebb away at last more than thirty million years hence the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens then i stopped once more for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared and the red beach save for its livid green liverworts and lichens seemed lifeless and now it was flecked with white a bitter cold assailed me rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down to the north-eastward the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and i could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white there were fringes of ice along the sea margin with drifting masses farther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean all bloody under the eternal sunset was still unfrozen
i looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained a certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine but i saw nothing moving in earth or sky or sea the green slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct a shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach i fancied i saw some black object flopping about upon this bank but it became motionless as i looked at it and i judged that my eye had been deceived and that the black object was merely a rock the stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little
suddenly i noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed; that a concavity a bay had appeared in the curve i saw this grow larger for a minute perhaps i stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over the day and then i realised that an eclipse was beginning either the moon or the planet mercury was passing across the suns disk naturally at first i took it to be the moon but there is much to incline me to believe that what i really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth
the darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number from the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent silent? it would be hard to convey the stillness of it all the sounds of man the bleating of sheep the cries of birds the hum of insects the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over as the darkness thickened the eddying flakes grew more abundant dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense at last one by one swiftly one after the other the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness the breeze rose to a moaning wind i saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me in another moment the pale stars alone were visible all else was rayless obscurity the sky was absolutely black
a horror of this great darkness came on me the cold that smote to my marrow and the pain i felt in breathing overcame me i shivered and a deadly nausea seized me then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun i got off the machine to recover myself i felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey as i stood sick and confused i saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the sea it was a round thing the size of a football perhaps or it may be bigger and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering blood-red water and it was hopping fitfully about then i felt i was fainting but a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while i clambered upon the saddle
xv the time travellers return so i came back for a long time i must have been insensible upon the machine the blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed the sun got golden again the sky blue i breathed with greater freedom the fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed the hands spun backward upon the dials at last i saw again the dim shadows of houses the evidences of decadent humanity these too changed and passed and others came presently when the million dial was at zero i slackened speed i began to recognise our own pretty and familiar architecture the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point the night and day flapped slower and slower then the old walls of the laboratory came round me very gently now i slowed the mechanism down
i saw one little thing that seemed odd to me i think i have told you that when i set out before my velocity became very high mrs watchett had walked across the room travelling as it seemed to me like a rocket as i returned i passed again across that minute when she traversed the laboratory but now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones the door at the lower end opened and she glided quietly up the laboratory back foremost and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered just before that i seemed to see hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a flash
then i stopped the machine and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory my tools my appliances just as i had left them i got off the thing very shakily and sat down upon my bench for several minutes i trembled violently then i became calmer around me was my old workshop again exactly as it had been i might have slept there and the whole thing have been a dream
and yet not exactly the thing had started from the south-east corner of the laboratory it had come to rest again in the north-west against the wall where you saw it that gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the white sphinx into which the morlocks had carried my machine
for a time my brain went stagnant presently i got up and came through the passage here limping because my heel was still painful and feeling sorely begrimed i saw the _pall mall gazette_ on the table by the door i found the date was indeed today and looking at the timepiece saw the hour was almost eight oclock i heard your voices and the clatter of plates i hesitated—i felt so sick and weak then i sniffed good wholesome meat and opened the door on you you know the rest i washed and dined and now i am telling you the story
xvi after the story i know he said after a pause that all this will be absolutely incredible to you but to me the one incredible thing is that i am here tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strange adventures he looked at the medical man no i cannot expect you to believe it take it as a lie—or a prophecy say i dreamed it in the workshop consider i have been speculating upon the destinies of our race until i have hatched this fiction treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest and taking it as a story what do you think of it?
he took up his pipe and began in his old accustomed manner to tap with it nervously upon the bars of the grate there was a momentary stillness then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet i took my eyes off the time travellers face and looked round at his audience they were in the dark and little spots of colour swam before them the medical man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our host the editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the sixth the journalist fumbled for his watch the others as far as i remember were motionless
the editor stood up with a sigh what a pity it is youre not a writer of stories he said putting his hand on the time travellers shoulder
you dont believe it? well—— i thought not
the time traveller turned to us where are the matches? he said he lit one and spoke over his pipe puffing to tell you the truth i hardly believe it myself and yet
his eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the little table then he turned over the hand holding his pipe and i saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles
the medical man rose came to the lamp and examined the flowers the gynæceums odd he said the psychologist leant forward to see holding out his hand for a specimen
im hanged if it isnt a quarter to one said the journalist how shall we get home?
plenty of cabs at the station said the psychologist
its a curious thing said the medical man; but i certainly dont know the natural order of these flowers may i have them?
the time traveller hesitated then suddenly: certainly not
where did you really get them? said the medical man
the time traveller put his hand to his head he spoke like one who was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him they were put into my pocket by weena when i travelled into time he stared round the room im damned if it isnt all going this room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory did i ever make a time machine or a model of a time machine? or is it all only a dream? they say life is a dream a precious poor dream at times—but i cant stand another that wont fit its madness and where did the dream come from? … i must look at that machine if there is one
he caught up the lamp swiftly and carried it flaring red through the door into the corridor we followed him there in the flickering light of the lamp was the machine sure enough squat ugly and askew a thing of brass ebony ivory and translucent glimmering quartz solid to the touch—for i put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory and bits of grass and moss upon the lower parts and one rail bent awry
the time traveller put the lamp down on the bench and ran his hand along the damaged rail its all right now he said the story i told you was true im sorry to have brought you out here in the cold he took up the lamp and in an absolute silence we returned to the smoking-room
he came into the hall with us and helped the editor on with his coat the medical man looked into his face and with a certain hesitation told him he was suffering from overwork at which he laughed hugely i remember him standing in the open doorway bawling good-night
i shared a cab with the editor he thought the tale a gaudy lie for my own part i was unable to come to a conclusion the story was so fantastic and incredible the telling so credible and sober i lay awake most of the night thinking about it i determined to go next day and see the time traveller again i was told he was in the laboratory and being on easy terms in the house i went up to him the laboratory however was empty i stared for a minute at the time machine and put out my hand and touched the lever at that the squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind its instability startled me extremely and i had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when i used to be forbidden to meddle i came back through the corridor the time traveller met me in the smoking-room he was coming from the house he had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other he laughed when he saw me and gave me an elbow to shake im frightfully busy said he with that thing in there
but is it not some hoax? i said do you really travel through time?
really and truly i do and he looked frankly into my eyes he hesitated his eye wandered about the room i only want half an hour he said i know why you came and its awfully good of you theres some magazines here if youll stop to lunch ill prove you this time travelling up to the hilt specimens and all if youll forgive my leaving you now?
i consented hardly comprehending then the full import of his words and he nodded and went on down the corridor i heard the door of the laboratory slam seated myself in a chair and took up a daily paper what was he going to do before lunch-time? then suddenly i was reminded by an advertisement that i had promised to meet richardson the publisher at two i looked at my watch and saw that i could barely save that engagement i got up and went down the passage to tell the time traveller
as i took hold of the handle of the door i heard an exclamation oddly truncated at the end and a click and a thud a gust of air whirled round me as i opened the door and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor the time traveller was not there i seemed to see a ghostly indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as i rubbed my eyes the time machine had gone save for a subsiding stir of dust the further end of the laboratory was empty a pane of the skylight had apparently just been blown in
i felt an unreasonable amazement i knew that something strange had happened and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be as i stood staring the door into the garden opened and the man-servant appeared
we looked at each other then ideas began to come has mr —— gone out that way? said i
no sir no one has come out this way i was expecting to find him here
at that i understood at the risk of disappointing richardson i stayed on waiting for the time traveller; waiting for the second perhaps still stranger story and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him but i am beginning now to fear that i must wait a lifetime the time traveller vanished three years ago and as everybody knows now he has never returned
epilogue one cannot choose but wonder will he ever return? it may be that he swept back into the past and fell among the blood-drinking hairy savages of the age of unpolished stone; into the abysses of the cretaceous sea; or among the grotesque saurians the huge reptilian brutes of the jurassic times he may even now—if i may use the phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted oolitic coral reef or beside the lonely saline seas of the triassic age or did he go forward into one of the nearer ages in which men are still men but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems solved? into the manhood of the race: for i for my own part cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment fragmentary theory and mutual discord are indeed mans culminating time i say for my own part he i know—for the question had been discussed among us long before the time machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the advancement of mankind and saw in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end if that is so it remains for us to live as though it were not so but to me the future is still black and blank—is a vast ignorance lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story and i have by me for my comfort two strange white flowers—shrivelled now and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that even when mind and strength had gone gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man
the crystal egg there was until a year ago a little and very grimy-looking shop near seven dials over which in weather-worn yellow lettering the name of c cave naturalist and dealer in antiquities was inscribed the contents of its window were curiously variegated they comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen beads and weapons a box of eyes two skulls of tigers and one human several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp) an old-fashioned cabinet a flyblown ostrich egg or so some fishing-tackle and an extraordinarily dirty empty glass fish-tank there was also at the moment the story begins a mass of crystal worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished and at that two people who stood outside the window were looking one of them a tall thin clergyman the other a black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume the dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article
while they were there mr cave came into his shop his beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea when he saw these men and the object of their regard his countenance fell he glanced guiltily over his shoulder and softly shut the door he was a little old man with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey and he wore a shabby blue frock coat an ancient silk hat and carpet slippers very much down at heel he remained watching the two men as they talked the clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket examined a handful of money and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depressed when they came into the shop
the clergyman without any ceremony asked the price of the crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour and said five pounds the clergyman protested that the price was high to his companion as well as to mr cave--it was indeed very much more than mr cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the article--and an attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to the shop-door and held it open five pounds is my price he said as though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion as he did so the upper portion of a womans face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour and stared curiously at the two customers five pounds is my price said mr cave with a quiver in his voice
the swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator watching cave keenly now he spoke give him five pounds he said the clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest and when he looked at mr cave again he saw that the latters face was white its a lot of money said the clergyman and diving into his pocket began counting his resources he had little more than thirty shillings and he appealed to his companion with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy this gave mr cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not as a matter of fact entirely free for sale his two customers were naturally surprised at this and inquired why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain mr cave became confused but he stuck to his story that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon that a probable purchaser of it had already appeared the two treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further made as if they would leave the shop but at this point the parlour door opened and the owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared
she was a coarse-featured corpulent woman younger and very much larger than mr cave; she walked heavily and her face was flushed that crystal _is_ for sale she said and five pounds is a good enough price for it i cant think what youre about cave not to take the gentlemans offer
mr cave greatly perturbed by the irruption looked angrily at her over the rims of his spectacles and without excessive assurance asserted his right to manage his business in his own way an altercation began the two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement occasionally assisting mrs cave with suggestions mr cave hard driven persisted in a confused and impossible story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning and his agitation became painful but he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence it was the young oriental who ended this curious controversy he proposed that they should call again in the course of two days--so as to give the alleged enquirer a fair chance and then we must insist said the clergyman five pounds mrs cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband explaining that he was sometimes a little odd and as the two customers left the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings
mrs cave talked to her husband with singular directness the poor little man quivering with emotion muddled himself between his stories maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas why did you ask five pounds? said his wife _do_ let me manage my business my own way said mr cave
mr cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son and at supper that night the transaction was re-discussed none of them had a high opinion of mr caves business methods and this action seemed a culminating folly
its my opinion hes refused that crystal before said the step-son a loose-limbed lout of eighteen
but _five pounds_ said the step-daughter an argumentative young woman of six-and-twenty
mr caves answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions that he knew his own business best they drove him from his half-eaten supper into the shop to close it for the night his ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles why had he left the crystal in the window so long? the folly of it that was the trouble closest in his mind for a time he could see no way of evading sale
after supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business aspects of the crystal over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water mr cave went into the shop and stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for goldfish cases but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later the next day mrs cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window and was lying behind some second-hand books on angling she replaced it in a conspicuous position but she did not argue further about it as a nervous headache disinclined her from debate mr cave was always disinclined the day passed disagreeably mr cave was if anything more absent-minded than usual and uncommonly irritable withal in the afternoon when his wife was taking her customary sleep he removed the crystal from the window again
the next day mr cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of the hospital schools where they were needed for dissection in his absence mrs caves mind reverted to the topic of the crystal and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds she had already devised some very agreeable expedients among others a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to richmond when a jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop the customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day mrs cave did not approve of this particular branch of mr caves business and the gentleman who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood retired after a brief exchange of words--entirely civil so far as he was concerned mrs caves eye then naturally turned to the window; for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams what was her surprise to find it gone
she went to the place behind the locker on the counter where she had discovered it the day before it was not there; and she immediately began an eager search about the shop
when mr cave returned from his business with the dog-fish about a quarter to two in the afternoon he found the shop in some confusion and his wife extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter routing among his taxidermic material her face came up hot and angry over the counter as the jangling bell announced his return and she forthwith accused him of hiding it
hid _what_? asked mr cave the crystal
at that mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to the window isnt it here? he said great heavens what has become of it?
just then mr caves step-son re-entered the shop from the inner room--he had come home a minute or so before mr cave--and he was blaspheming freely he was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer down the road but he had his meals at home and he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready
but when he heard of the loss of the crystal he forgot his meal and his anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father their first idea of course was that he had hidden it but mr cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its fate--freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the matter--and at last was worked up to the point of accusing first his wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a view to a private sale so began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion which ended for mrs cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon mr cave took refuge from his wifes emotions in the shop
in the evening the matter was resumed with less passion and in a judicial spirit under the presidency of the step-daughter the supper passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation and went out banging the front door violently the rest of the family having discussed him with the freedom his absence warranted hunted the house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon the crystal
the next day the two customers called again they were received by mrs cave almost in tears it transpired that no one _could_ imagine all that she had stood from cave at various times in her married pilgrimage she also gave a garbled account of the disappearance the clergyman and the oriental laughed silently at one another and said it was very extraordinary as mrs cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop thereupon mrs cave still clinging to hope asked for the clergymans address so that if she could get anything out of cave she might communicate it the address was duly given but apparently was afterwards mislaid mrs cave can remember nothing about it
in the evening of that day the caves seem to have exhausted their emotions and mr cave who had been out in the afternoon supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the previous days for some time matters were very badly strained in the cave household but neither crystal nor customer reappeared
now without mincing the matter we must admit that mr cave was a liar he knew perfectly well where the crystal was it was in the rooms of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherines hospital westbourne street it stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth and beside a decanter of american whisky it is from mr wace indeed that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dog-fish sack and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for him mr wace was a little dubious at first his relationship to cave was peculiar he had a taste for singular characters and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular mr wace had encountered mrs cave too on occasions when mr cave was not at home to attend to him he knew the constant interference to which cave was subjected and having weighed the story judicially he decided to give the crystal a refuge mr cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein he called on mr wace the same evening
he told a complicated story the crystal he said had come into his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity dealers effects and not knowing what its value might be he had ticketed it at ten shillings it had hung upon his hands at that price for some months and he was thinking of reducing the figure when he made a singular discovery
at that time his health was very bad--and it must be borne in mind that throughout all this experience his physical condition was one of ebb--and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence the positive ill-treatment even he received from his wife and step-children his wife was vain extravagant unfeeling and had a growing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and over-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him and lost no chance of showing it the requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him and mr wace does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance he had begun life in a comfortable position he was a man of fair education and he suffered for weeks at a stretch from melancholia and insomnia afraid to disturb his family he would slip quietly from his wifes side when his thoughts became intolerable and wander about the house and about three oclock one morning late in august chance directed him into the shop
the dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot where he perceived an unusual glow of light approaching this he discovered it to be the crystal egg which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the window a thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters impinged upon the object and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior
it occurred to mr cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days he could understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions he approached the crystal nearly peering into it and round it with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a calling he was surprised to find the light not steady but writhing within the substance of the egg as though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour in moving about to get different points of view he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray and that the crystal none the less remained luminous greatly astonished he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop it remained bright for some four or five minutes when it slowly faded and went out he placed it in the thin streak of daylight and its luminousness was almost immediately restored
so far at least mr wace was able to verify the remarkable story of mr cave he has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light (which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre) and in a perfect darkness such as could be produced by velvet wrapping the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent it would seem however that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort and not equally visible to all eyes; for mr harbinger--whose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the pasteur institute--was quite unable to see any light whatever and mr waces own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of mr caves even with mr cave the power varied very considerably: his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue
now from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon mr cave and it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do that he told no human being of his curious observations he seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it he found that as the dawn advanced and the amount of diffused light increased the crystal became to all appearance non-luminous and for some time he was unable to see anything in it except at night-time in dark corners of the shop
but the use of an old velvet cloth which he used as a background for a collection of minerals occurred to him and by doubling this and putting it over his head and hands he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in the daytime he was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons while she was asleep upstairs and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter and one day turning the crystal about in his hands he saw something it came and went like a flash but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country; and turning it about he did just as the light faded see the same vision again
now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of mr caves discovery from this point suffice that the effect was this: the crystal being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray gave a clear and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar countryside it was not dream-like at all: it produced a definite impression of reality and the better the light the more real and solid it seemed it was a moving picture: that is to say certain objects moved in it but slowly in an orderly manner like real things and according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed the picture changed also it must indeed have been like looking through an oval glass at a view and turning the glass about to get at different aspects
mr caves statements mr wace assures me were extremely circumstantial and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints hallucinatory impressions but it must be remembered that all the efforts of mr wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful try as he would the difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to mr cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to mr wace
the view as mr cave described it was invariably of an extensive plain and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height as if from a tower or a mast to the east and to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture; but what the picture was mr wace was unable to ascertain these cliffs passed north and south--he could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night--receding in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met he was nearer the eastern set of cliffs on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that mr cave regarded as birds a vast range of buildings spread below him; he seemed to be looking down upon them; and as they approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became indistinct there were also trees curious in shape and in colouring a deep mossy green and an exquisite grey beside a wide and shining canal and something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture but the first time mr cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes his hands shook his head moved the vision came and went and grew foggy and indistinct and at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost
his next clear vision which came about a week after the first the interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful experience showed him the view down the length of the valley the view was different but he had a curious persuasion which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed that he was regarding this strange world from exactly the same spot although he was looking in a different direction the long façade of the great building whose roof he had looked down upon before was now receding in perspective he recognised the roof in the front of the façade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length and down the middle of the terrace at certain intervals stood huge but very graceful masts bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun the import of these small objects did not occur to mr cave until some time after as he was describing the scene to mr wace the terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures in form like beetles but enormously larger reposed beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone; and beyond that and lined with dense _red_ weeds and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs was a broad and mirror-like expanse of water the air seemed full of squadrons of great birds manœuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets among a forest of moss-like and lichenous trees and suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing and a face or rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes came as it were close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal mr cave was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it he had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop with its familiar odour of methyl mustiness and decay and as he blinked about him the glowing crystal faded and went out
such were the first general impressions of mr cave the story is curiously direct and circumstantial from the outset when the valley first flashed momentarily on his senses his imagination was strangely affected and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw his wonder rose to the point of a passion he went about his business listless and distraught thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his watching and then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two customers the stress and excitement of their offer and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale as i have already told
now while the thing was mr caves secret it remained a mere wonder a thing to creep to covertly and peep at as a child might peep upon a forbidden garden but mr wace has for a young scientific investigator a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind directly the crystal and its story came to him and he had satisfied himself by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes that there really was a certain evidence for mr caves statements he proceeded to develop the matter systematically mr cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw and he came every night from half-past eight until half-past ten and sometimes in mr waces absence during the day on sunday afternoons also he came from the outset mr wace made copious notes and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of the picture were proved and by covering the crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds he greatly improved the conditions of the observations; so that in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired
so having cleared the way we may give a brief account of this visionary world within the crystal the things were in all cases seen by mr cave and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and report what he saw while mr wace (who as a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his report when the crystal faded it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on mr wace asked questions and suggested observations to clear up difficult points nothing indeed could have been less visionary and more matter-of-fact
the attention of mr cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions his first impression was soon corrected and he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat then he thought grotesquely enough that they might be cherubs their heads were round and curiously human and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his second observation they had broad silvery wings not feathered but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed fish and with the same subtle play of colour and these wings were not built on the plan of bird-wing or bat mr wace learned but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body (a sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their appearance) the body was small but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately under the mouth incredible as it appeared to mr wace the persuasion at last became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid and mr cave perceived that the buildings with other peculiarities had no doors but that the great circular windows which opened freely gave the creatures egress and entrance they would alight upon their tentacles fold their wings to a smallness almost rod-like and hop into the interior but among them was a multitude of smaller-winged creatures like great dragon-flies and moths and flying beetles and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro moreover on the causeways and terraces large-headed creatures similar to the greater winged flies but wingless were visible hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of tentacles
allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building it dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he peered and a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object
occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast would regard the crystal fixedly for a space--sometimes for as long as fifteen minutes and a series of observations made at the suggestion of mr wace convinced both watchers that so far as this visionary world was concerned the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace and that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into mr caves face while he was making these observations
so much for the essential facts of this very singular story unless we dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of mr wace we have to believe one of two things: either that mr caves crystal was in two worlds at once and that while it was carried about in one it remained stationary in the other which seems altogether absurd; or else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other world so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world was under suitable conditions visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world; and _vice versa_ at present indeed we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so come _en rapport_ but nowadays we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible this view of the crystals as _en rapport_ was the supposition that occurred to mr wace and to me at least it seems extremely plausible
and where was this other world? on this also the alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset the sky darkened rapidly--there was a very brief twilight interval indeed--and the stars shone out they were recognisably the same as those we see arranged in the same constellations mr cave recognised the bear the pleiades aldebaran and sirius: so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system and at the utmost only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own following up this clue mr wace learned that the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky and that the sun seemed a little smaller _and there were two small moons_ like our moon but smaller and quite differently marked one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it these moons were never high in the sky but vanished as they rose: that is every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet and all this answers quite completely although mr cave did not know it to what must be the condition of things on mars
indeed it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into this crystal mr cave did actually see the planet mars and its inhabitants and if that be the case then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth
for a time the martians--if they were martians--do not seem to have known of mr caves inspection once or twice one would come to peer and go away very shortly to some other mast as though the vision was unsatisfactory during this time mr cave was able to watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their attentions and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary it is nevertheless very suggestive imagine the impression of humanity a martian observer would get who after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes was able to peer at london from the steeple of st martins church for stretches at longest of four minutes at a time mr cave was unable to ascertain if the winged martians were the same as the martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces and if the latter could put on wings at will he several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive of apes white and partially translucent feeding among certain of the lichenous trees and once some of these fled before one of the hopping round-headed martians the latter caught one in its tentacles and then the picture faded suddenly and left mr cave most tantalisingly in the dark on another occasion a vast thing that mr cave thought at first was some gigantic insect appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity as this drew nearer mr cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity and then when he looked again it had passed out of sight
after a time mr wace aspired to attract the attention of the martians and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the crystal mr cave cried out and sprang away and they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling but when at last mr cave examined the crystal again the martian had departed
thus far these observations had progressed in early november and then mr cave feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were allayed began to take it to and fro with him in order that as occasion arose in the daytime or night he might comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence
in december mr waces work in connection with a forthcoming examination became heavy the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week and for ten or eleven days--he is not quite sure which--he saw nothing of cave he then grew anxious to resume these investigations and the stress of his seasonal labours being abated he went down to seven dials at the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fanciers window and then another at a cobblers mr caves shop was closed
he rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black he at once called mrs cave who was mr wace could not but observe in cheap but ample widows weeds of the most imposing pattern without any very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave was dead and already buried she was in tears and her voice was a little thick she had just returned from highgate her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies but mr wace was at last able to learn the particulars of caves death he had been found dead in his shop in the early morning the day after his last visit to mr wace and the crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands his face was smiling said mrs cave and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet he must have been dead five or six hours when he was found
this came as a great shock to wace and he began to reproach himself bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old mans ill-health but his chief thought was of the crystal he approached that topic in a gingerly manner because he knew mrs caves peculiarities he was dumbfounded to learn that it was sold
mrs caves first impulse directly caves body had been taken upstairs had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the crystal informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt in which her daughter joined her they were convinced of the loss of his address as they were without the means required to mourn and bury cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old seven dials inhabitant demands they had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in great portland street he had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation the valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots mr wace after a few suitable consolatory observations a little off-handedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street but there he learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall dark man in grey and there the material facts in this curious and to me at least very suggestive story come abruptly to an end the great portland street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely he did not even know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop for a time mr wace remained in the shop trying the dealers patience with hopeless questions venting his own exasperation and at last realising abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands had vanished like a vision of the night he returned to his own rooms a little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table
his annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great he made a second call (equally ineffectual) upon the great portland street dealer and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were likely to come into the hands of a _bric-a-brac_ collector he also wrote letters to _the daily chronicle_ and _nature_ but both those periodicals suspecting a hoax asked him to reconsider his action before they printed and he was advised that such a strange story unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence might imperil his reputation as an investigator moreover the calls of his proper work were urgent so that after a month or so save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg and from that day to this it remains undiscovered occasionally however he tells me and i can quite believe him he has bursts of zeal in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search
whether or not it will remain lost for ever with the material and origin of it are things equally speculative at the present time if the present purchaser is a collector one would have expected the enquiries of mr wace to have reached him through the dealers he has been able to discover mr caves clergyman and oriental--no other than the rev james parker and the young prince of bosso-kuni in java i am obliged to them for certain particulars the object of the prince was simply curiosity--and extravagance he was so eager to buy because cave was so oddly reluctant to sell it is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all and the crystal egg for all i know may at the present moment be within a mile of me decorating a drawing-room or serving as a paper-weight--its remarkable functions all unknown indeed it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that i have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction
my own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of mr wace i believe the crystal on the mast in mars and the crystal egg of mr caves to be in some physical but at present quite inexplicable way _en rapport_ and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have been--possibly at some remote date--sent hither from that planet in order to give the martians a near view of our affairs possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are also on our globe no theory of hallucination suffices for the facts
the star the star it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made almost simultaneously from three observatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun had become very erratic ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity in december such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any very great excitement scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind
few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of the solar system the sun with its specks of planets its dust of planetoids and its impalpable comets swims in a vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty million times a million miles that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun by the second day it was clearly visible to any decent instrument as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus in a little while an opera glass could attain it
on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchaines opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune the leader writers enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on january 3rd there was an expectation however vague of some imminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see--the old familiar stars just as they had always been
until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale the winters dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of daylight and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of news-carts dissipation going home jaded and pale homeless wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country labourers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it could be seen--and out at sea by seamen watching for the day--a great white star come suddenly into the westward sky
brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening star at its brightest it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disc an hour after the day had come and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast negroes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star
and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together and a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope and this appliance and that to record this novel astonishing sight the destruction of a world for it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth indeed that had so suddenly flashed into flaming death neptune it was had been struck fairly and squarely by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it everywhere men marvelled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night
and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on house-roofs in open spaces staring eastward for the rising of the great new star it rose with a white glow in front of it like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it it is larger they cried it is brighter and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star
it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another _it is nearer_ they said _nearer_
and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type it is nearer men writing in offices struck with a strange realisation flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer it hurried along awakening streets it was shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellow-lit doorways shouting the news to the passers-by it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly between the dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel nearer indeed how curious how very very clever people must be to find out things like that
lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselves--looking skyward it has need to be nearer for the nights as cold as charity dont seem much warmth from it if it _is_ nearer all the same
what is a new star to me? cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead
the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himself--with the great white star shining broad and bright through the frost-flowers of his window centrifugal centripetal he said with his chin on his fist stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then? centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun and this--
do _we_ come in the way? i wonder--
the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself hanging huge in the sunset in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer under capricorn two negro lovers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fire-flies hovered that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light
the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him his calculations were already finished in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to this momentous calculation his face was grave a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click half way up the sky over the clustering roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star
he looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy you may kill me he said after a silence but i can hold you--and all the universe for that matter--in the grip of this little brain i would not change even now
he looked at the little phial there will be no need of sleep again he said the next day at noon punctual to the minute he entered his lecture theatre put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply he came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing circumstances have arisen--circumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly that--man has lived in vain
the students glanced at one another had they heard aright? mad? raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm grey-fringed face it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion let us assume--
he turned towards the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him what was that about lived in vain? whispered one student to another listen said the other nodding towards the lecturer
and presently they began to understand
that night the star rose later for its proper eastward motion had carried it some way across leo towards virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star was hidden in its turn save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the pointers of the bear it was very white and beautiful in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about it was perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan
and everywhere the world was awake that night and throughout christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside like the belling of bees in the heather and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the cities it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star
and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilised lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster towards the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew now indeed it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction? inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass very close to our earth earthquakes volcanic outbreaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limit--so prophesied the master mathematician
and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom
to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approaching and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw
but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades the workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000--for then too people had anticipated the end the star was no star--mere gas--a comet; and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing common sense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at seven-fifteen by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathematicians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate self-advertisement common sense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novelty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beast world left the star unheeded
and yet when at last the watchers in the european states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than it had been the night before there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematician--to take the danger as if it had passed
but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grew--it grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into a second day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america near the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and _hot_; and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunder-clouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soon--in their upper reaches--with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily steadily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys
and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic the tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction the whole side of cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it reached the sea
so the star with the wan moon in its wake marched across the pacific trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe and the growing tidal wave that toiled behind it frothing and eager poured over island and island and swept them clear of men until that wave came at last--in a blinding light and with the breath of a furnace swift and terrible it came--a wall of water fifty feet high roaring hungrily upon the long coasts of asia and swept inland across the plains of china for a space the star hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country; towns and villages with their pagodas and trees roads wide cultivated fields millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the incandescent sky; and then low and growing came the murmur of the flood and thus it was with millions of men that night--a flight nowhither with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant and the flood like a wall swift and white behind and then death
china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming above was the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks soon the immemorial snows of thibet and the himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burmah and hindostan the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire and in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad river-ways to that one last hope of men--the open sea
larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now the tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with storm-tossed ships
and then came a wonder it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain hour followed hour through a terrible suspense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had counted lost to them forever in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetually but in the tropics sirius and capella and aldebaran showed through a veil of steam and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the centre of its white heart was a disc of black
over asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them the whole land seemed a-wailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air men looking up near blinded at the star saw that a black disc was creeping across the light it was the moon coming between the star and the earth and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens
so it was that presently to the european watchers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the sky and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun
and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mud-silted ruins and the earth littered like a storm-worn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children for days the water streamed off the land sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dykes and scooping out titanic gullies over the country side those were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued
but the star had passed and men hunger-driven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its former size took now fourscore days between its new and new
but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and books and machines of the strange change that had come over iceland and greenland and the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter northward and southward towards the poles of the earth it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star
the martian astronomers--for there are astronomers on mars although they are very different beings from men--were naturally profoundly interested by these things they saw them from their own standpoint of course considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what a little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discolouration (supposed to be frozen water) round either pole which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem at a distance of a few million miles
a story of the stone age
a story of the stone age
i--ugh-lomi and uya this story is of a time beyond the memory of man before the beginning of history a time when one might have walked dryshod from france (as we call it now) to england and when a broad and sluggish thames flowed through its marshes to meet its father rhine flowing through a wide and level country that is under water in these latter days and which we know by the name of the north sea in that remote age the valley which runs along the foot of the downs did not exist and the south of surrey was a range of hills fir-clad on the middle slopes and snow-capped for the better part of the year the cores of its summits still remain as leith hill and pitch hill and hindhead on the lower slopes of the range below the grassy spaces where the wild horses grazed were forests of yew and sweet-chestnut and elm and the thickets and dark places hid the grizzly bear and the hyæna and the grey apes clambered through the branches and still lower amidst the woodland and marsh and open grass along the wey did this little drama play itself out to the end that i have to tell fifty thousand years ago it was fifty thousand years--if the reckoning of geologists is correct
and in those days the spring-time was as joyful as it is now and sent the blood coursing in just the same fashion the afternoon sky was blue with piled white clouds sailing through it and the southwest wind came like a soft caress the new-come swallows drove to and fro the reaches of the river were spangled with white ranunculus the marshy places were starred with ladys-smock and lit with marsh-mallow wherever the regiments of the sedges lowered their swords and the northward-moving hippopotami shiny black monsters sporting clumsily came floundering and blundering through it all rejoicing dimly and possessed with one clear idea to splash the river muddy
up the river and well in sight of the hippopotami a number of little buff-coloured animals dabbled in the water there was no fear no rivalry and no enmity between them and the hippopotami as the great bulks came crashing through the reeds and smashed the mirror of the water into silvery splashes these little creatures shouted and gesticulated with glee it was the surest sign of high spring boloo they cried baayah boloo they were the children of the men folk the smoke of whose encampment rose from the knoll at the rivers bend wild-eyed youngsters they were with matted hair and little broad-nosed impish faces covered (as some children are covered even nowadays) with a delicate down of hair they were narrow in the loins and long in the arms and their ears had no lobes and had little pointed tips a thing that still in rare instances survives stark-naked vivid little gipsies as active as monkeys and as full of chatter though a little wanting in words
their elders were hidden from the wallowing hippopotami by the crest of the knoll the human squatting-place was a trampled area among the dead brown fronds of royal fern through which the crosiers of this years growth were unrolling to the light and warmth the fire was a smouldering heap of char light grey and black replenished by the old women from time to time with brown leaves most of the men were asleep--they slept sitting with their foreheads on their knees they had killed that morning a good quarry enough for all a deer that had been wounded by hunting dogs; so that there had been no quarrelling among them and some of the women were still gnawing the bones that lay scattered about others were making a heap of leaves and sticks to feed brother fire when the darkness came again that he might grow strong and tall therewith and guard them against the beasts and two were piling flints that they brought an armful at a time from the bend of the river where the children were at play
none of these buff-skinned savages were clothed but some wore about their hips rude girdles of adder-skin or crackling undressed hide from which depended little bags not made but torn from the paws of beasts and carrying the rudely-dressed flints that were mens chief weapons and tools and one woman the mate of uya the cunning man wore a wonderful necklace of perforated fossils--that others had worn before her beside some of the sleeping men lay the big antlers of the elk with the tines chipped to sharp edges and long sticks hacked at the ends with flints into sharp points there was little else save these things and the smouldering fire to mark these human beings off from the wild animals that ranged the country but uya the cunning did not sleep but sat with a bone in his hand and scraped busily thereon with a flint a thing no animal would do he was the oldest man in the tribe beetle-browed prognathous lank-armed; he had a beard and his cheeks were hairy and his chest and arms were black with thick hair and by virtue both of his strength and cunning he was master of the tribe and his share was always the most and the best
eudena had hidden herself among the alders because she was afraid of uya she was still a girl and her eyes were bright and her smile pleasant to see he had given her a piece of the liver a mans piece and a wonderful treat for a girl to get; but as she took it the other woman with the necklace had looked at her an evil glance and ugh-lomi had made a noise in his throat at that uya had looked at him long and steadfastly and ugh-lomis face had fallen and then uya had looked at her she was frightened and she had stolen away while the feeding was still going on and uya was busy with the marrow of a bone afterwards he had wandered about as if looking for her and now she crouched among the alders wondering mightily what uya might be doing with the flint and the bone and ugh-lomi was not to be seen
presently a squirrel came leaping through the alders and she lay so quiet the little man was within six feet of her before he saw her whereupon he dashed up a stem in a hurry and began to chatter and scold her what are you doing here he asked away from the other men beasts? peace said eudena but he only chattered more and then she began to break off the little black cones to throw at him he dodged and defied her and she grew excited and rose up to throw better and then she saw uya coming down the knoll he had seen the movement of her pale arm amidst the thicket--he was very keen-eyed
at that she forgot the squirrel and set off through the alders and reeds as fast as she could go she did not care where she went so long as she escaped uya she splashed nearly knee-deep through a swampy place and saw in front of her a slope of ferns--growing more slender and green as they passed up out of the light into the shade of the young chestnuts she was soon amidst the trees--she was very fleet of foot and she ran on and on until the forest was old and the vales great and the vines about their stems where the light came were thick as young trees and the ropes of ivy stout and tight on she went and she doubled and doubled again and then at last lay down amidst some ferns in a hollow place near a thicket and listened with her heart beating in her ears
she heard footsteps presently rustling among the dead leaves far off and they died away and everything was still again except the scandalising of the midges--for the evening was drawing on--and the incessant whisper of the leaves she laughed silently to think the cunning uya should go by her she was not frightened sometimes playing with the other girls and lads she had fled into the wood though never so far as this it was pleasant to be hidden and alone
she lay a long time there glad of her escape and then she sat up listening
it was a rapid pattering growing louder and coming towards her and in a little while she could hear grunting noises and the snapping of twigs it was a drove of lean grisly wild swine she turned about her for a boar is an ill fellow to pass too closely on account of the sideway slash of his tusks and she made off slantingly through the trees but the patter came nearer they were not feeding as they wandered but going fast--or else they would not overtake her--and she caught the limb of a tree swung on to it and ran up the stem with something of the agility of a monkey
down below the sharp bristling backs of the swine were already passing when she looked and she knew the short sharp grunts they made meant fear what were they afraid of? a man? they were in a great hurry for just a man
and then so suddenly it made her grip on the branch tighten involuntarily a fawn started in the brake and rushed after the swine something else went by low and grey with a long body; she did not know what it was indeed she saw it only momentarily through the interstices of the young leaves; and then there came a pause
she remained stiff and expectant as rigid almost as though she was a part of the tree she clung to peering down
then far away among the trees clear for a moment then hidden then visible knee-deep in ferns then gone again ran a man she knew it was young ugh-lomi by the fair colour of his hair and there was red upon his face somehow his frantic flight and that scarlet mark made her feel sick and then nearer running heavily and breathing hard came another man at first she could not see and then she saw foreshortened and clear to her uya running with great strides and his eyes staring he was not going after ugh-lomi his face was white it was uya--_afraid_ he passed and was still loud hearing when something else something large and with grizzled fur swinging along with soft swift strides came rushing in pursuit of him
eudena suddenly became rigid ceased to breathe her clutch convulsive and her eyes starting
she had never seen the thing before she did not even see him clearly now but she knew at once it was the terror of the woodshade his name was a legend the children would frighten one another frighten even themselves with his name and run screaming to the squatting-place no man had ever killed any of his kind even the mighty mammoth feared his anger it was the grizzly bear the lord of the world as the world went then
as he ran he made a continuous growling grumble men in my very lair fighting and blood at the very mouth of my lair men men men fighting and blood for he was the lord of the wood and of the caves
long after he had passed she remained a girl of stone staring down through the branches all her power of action had gone from her she gripped by instinct with hands and knees and feet it was some time before she could think and then only one thing was clear in her mind that the terror was between her and the tribe--that it would be impossible to descend
presently when her fear was a little abated she clambered into a more comfortable position where a great branch forked the trees rose about her so that she could see nothing of brother fire who is black by day birds began to stir and things that had gone into hiding for fear of her movements crept out
after a time the taller branches flamed out at the touch of the sunset high overhead the rooks who were wiser than men went cawing home to their squatting-places among the elms looking down things were clearer and darker eudena thought of going back to the squatting-place; she let herself down some way and then the fear of the terror of the woodshade came again while she hesitated a rabbit squealed dismally and she dared not descend farther
the shadows gathered and the deeps of the forest began stirring eudena went up the tree again to be nearer the light down below the shadows came out of their hiding-places and walked abroad overhead the blue deepened a dreadful stillness came and then the leaves began whispering
eudena shivered and thought of brother fire
the shadows now were gathering in the trees they sat on the branches and watched her branches and leaves were turned to ominous quiet black shapes that would spring on her if she stirred then the white owl flitting silently came ghostly through the shades darker grew the world and darker until the leaves and twigs against the sky were black and the ground was hidden
she remained there all night an age-long vigil straining her ears for the things that went on below in the darkness and keeping motionless lest some stealthy beast should discover her man in those days was never alone in the dark save for such rare accidents as this age after age he had learnt the lesson of its terror--a lesson we poor children of his have nowadays painfully to unlearn eudena though in age a woman was in heart like a little child she kept as still poor little animal as a hare before it is started
the stars gathered and watched her--her one grain of comfort in one bright one she fancied there was something like ugh-lomi then she fancied it _was_ ugh-lomi and near him red and duller was uya and as the night passed ugh-lomi fled before him up the sky
she tried to see brother fire who guarded the squatting-place from beasts but he was not in sight and far away she heard the mammoths trumpeting as they went down to the drinking-place and once some huge bulk with heavy paces hurried along making a noise like a calf but what it was she could not see but she thought from the voice it was yaaa the rhinoceros who stabs with his nose goes always alone and rages without cause
at last the little stars began to hide and then the larger ones it was like all the animals vanishing before the terror the sun was coming lord of the sky as the grizzly was lord of the forest eudena wondered what would happen if one star stayed behind and then the sky paled to the dawn
when the daylight came the fear of lurking things passed and she could descend she was stiff but not so stiff as you would have been dear young lady (by virtue of your upbringing) and as she had not been trained to eat at least once in three hours but instead had often fasted three days she did not feel uncomfortably hungry she crept down the tree very cautiously and went her way stealthily through the wood and not a squirrel sprang or deer started but the terror of the grizzly bear froze her marrow
her desire was now to find her people again her dread of uya the cunning was consumed by a greater dread of loneliness but she had lost her direction she had run heedlessly overnight and she could not tell whether the squatting-place was sunward or where it lay ever and again she stopped and listened and at last very far away she heard a measured chinking it was so faint even in the morning stillness that she could tell it must be far away but she knew the sound was that of a man sharpening a flint
presently the trees began to thin out and then came a regiment of nettles barring the way she turned aside and then she came to a fallen tree that she knew with a noise of bees about it and so presently she was in sight of the knoll very far off and the river under it and the children and the hippopotami just as they had been yesterday and the thin spire of smoke swaying in the morning breeze far away by the river was the cluster of alders where she had hidden and at the sight of that the fear of uya returned and she crept into a thicket of bracken out of which a rabbit scuttled and lay awhile to watch the squatting-place
the men were mostly out of sight saving wau the flint-chopper; and at that she felt safer they were away hunting food no doubt some of the women too were down in the stream stooping intent seeking mussels crayfish and water-snails and at the sight of their occupation eudena felt hungry she rose and ran through the fern designing to join them as she went she heard a voice among the bracken calling softly she stopped then suddenly she heard a rustle behind her and turning saw ugh-lomi rising out of the fern there were streaks of brown blood and dirt on his face and his eyes were fierce and the white stone of uya the white fire stone that none but uya dared to touch was in his hand in a stride he was beside her and gripped her arm he swung her about and thrust her before him towards the woods uya he said and waved his arms about she heard a cry looked back and saw all the women standing up and two wading out of the stream then came a nearer howling and the old woman with the beard who watched the fire on the knoll was waving her arms and wau the man who had been chipping the flint was getting to his feet the little children too were hurrying and shouting
come said ugh-lomi and dragged her by the arm
she still did not understand uya has called the death word said ugh-lomi and she glanced back at the screaming curve of figures and understood
wau and all the women and children were coming towards them a scattered array of buff shock-headed figures howling leaping and crying over the knoll two youths hurried down among the ferns to the right came a man heading them off from the wood ugh-lomi left her arm and the two began running side by side leaping the bracken and stepping clear and wide eudena knowing her fleetness and the fleetness of ugh-lomi laughed aloud at the unequal chase they were an exceptionally straight-limbed couple for those days
they soon cleared the open and drew near the wood of chestnut-trees again--neither afraid now because neither was alone they slackened their pace already not excessive and suddenly eudena cried and swerved aside pointing and looking up through the tree-stems ugh-lomi saw the feet and legs of men running towards him eudena was already running off at a tangent and as he too turned to follow her they heard the voice of uya coming through the trees and roaring out his rage at them
then terror came in their hearts not the terror that numbs but the terror that makes one silent and swift they were cut off now on two sides they were in a sort of corner of pursuit on the right hand and near by them came the men swift and heavy with bearded uya antler in hand leading them; and on the left scattered as one scatters corn yellow dashes among the fern and grass ran wau and the women; and even the little children from the shallow had joined the chase the two parties converged upon them off they went with eudena ahead
they knew there was no mercy for them there was no hunting so sweet to these ancient men as the hunting of men once the fierce passion of the chase was lit the feeble beginnings of humanity in them were thrown to the winds and uya in the night had marked ugh-lomi with the death word ugh-lomi was the days quarry the appointed feast
they ran straight--it was their only chance--taking whatever ground came in the way--a spread of stinging nettles an open glade a clump of grass out of which a hyæna fled snarling then woods again long stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under the green trunks then a stiff slope tree-clad and long vistas of trees a glade a succulent green area of black mud a wide open space again and then a clump of lacerating brambles with beast tracks through it behind them the chase trailed out and scattered with uya ever at their heels eudena kept the first place running light and with her breath easy for ugh-lomi carried the fire stone in his hand
it told on his pace--not at first but after a time his footsteps behind her suddenly grew remote glancing over her shoulder as they crossed another open space eudena saw that ugh-lomi was many yards behind her and uya close upon him with antler already raised in the air to strike him down wau and the others were but just emerging from the shadow of the woods
seeing ugh-lomi in peril eudena ran sideways looking back threw up her arms and cried aloud just as the antler flew and young ugh-lomi expecting this and understanding her cry ducked his head so that the missile merely struck his scalp lightly making but a trivial wound and flew over him he turned forthwith the quartzite fire stone in both hands and hurled it straight at uyas body as he ran loose from the throw uya shouted but could not dodge it it took him under the ribs heavy and flat and he reeled and went down without a cry ugh-lomi caught up the antler--one tine of it was tipped with his own blood--and came running on again with a red trickle just coming out of his hair
uya rolled over twice and lay a moment before he got up and then he did not run fast the colour of his face was changed wau overtook him and then others and he coughed and laboured in his breath but he kept on
at last the two fugitives gained the bank of the river where the stream ran deep and narrow and they still had fifty yards in hand of wau the foremost pursuer the man who made the smiting-stones he carried one a large flint the shape of an oyster and double the size chipped to a chisel edge in either hand
they sprang down the steep bank into the stream rushed through the water swam the deep current in two or three strokes and came out wading again dripping and refreshed to clamber up the farther bank it was undermined and with willows growing thickly therefrom so that it needed clambering and while eudena was still among the silvery branches and ugh-lomi still in the water--for the antler had encumbered him--wau came up against the sky on the opposite bank and the smiting-stone thrown cunningly took the side of eudenas knee she struggled to the top and fell
they heard the pursuers shout to one another and ugh-lomi climbing to her and moving jerkily to mar waus aim felt the second smiting-stone graze his ear and heard the water splash below him
then it was ugh-lomi the stripling proved himself to have come to mans estate for running on he found eudena fell behind limping and at that he turned and crying savagely and with a face terrible with sudden wrath and trickling blood ran swiftly past her back to the bank whirling the antler round his head and eudena kept on running stoutly still though she must needs limp at every step and the pain was already sharp
so that wau rising over the edge and clutching the straight willow branches saw ugh-lomi towering over him gigantic against the blue; saw his whole body swing round and the grip of his hands upon the antler the edge of the antler came sweeping through the air and he saw no more the water under the osiers whirled and eddied and went crimson six feet down the stream uya following stopped knee-high across the stream and the man who was swimming turned about
the other men who trailed after--they were none of them very mighty men (for uya was more cunning than strong brooking no sturdy rivals)--slackened momentarily at the sight of ugh-lomi standing there above the willows bloody and terrible between them and the halting girl with the huge antler waving in his hand it seemed as though he had gone into the water a youth and come out of it a man full grown
he knew what there was behind him a broad stretch of grass and then a thicket and in that eudena could hide that was clear in his mind though his thinking powers were too feeble to see what should happen thereafter uya stood knee-deep undecided and unarmed his heavy mouth hung open showing his canine teeth and he panted heavily his side was flushed and bruised under the hair the other man beside him carried a sharpened stick the rest of the hunters came up one by one to the top of the bank hairy long-armed men clutching flints and sticks two ran off along the bank down stream and then clambered to the water where wau had come to the surface struggling weakly before they could reach him he went under again two others threatened ugh-lomi from the bank
he answered back shouts vague insults gestures then uya who had been hesitating roared with rage and whirling his fists plunged into the water his followers splashed after him
ugh-lomi glanced over his shoulder and found eudena already vanished into the thicket he would perhaps have waited for uya but uya preferred to spar in the water below him until the others were beside him human tactics in those days in all serious fighting were the tactics of the pack prey that turned at bay they gathered around and rushed ugh-lomi felt the rush coming and hurling the antler at uya turned about and fled
when he halted to look back from the shadow of the thicket he found only three of his pursuers had followed him across the river and they were going back again uya with a bleeding mouth was on the farther side of the stream again but lower down and holding his hand to his side the others were in the river dragging something to shore for a time at least the chase was intermitted
ugh-lomi stood watching for a space and snarled at the sight of uya then he turned and plunged into the thicket
in a minute eudena came hastening to join him and they went on hand in hand he dimly perceived the pain she suffered from the cut and bruised knee and chose the easier ways but they went on all that day mile after mile through wood and thicket until at last they came to the chalkland open grass with rare woods of beech and the birch growing near water and they saw the wealden mountains nearer and groups of horses grazing together they went circumspectly keeping always near thicket and cover for this was a strange region--even its ways were strange steadily the ground rose until the chestnut forests spread wide and blue below them and the thames marshes shone silvery high and far they saw no men for in those days men were still only just come into this part of the world and were moving but slowly along the river-ways towards evening they came on the river again but now it ran in a gorge between high cliffs of white chalk that sometimes overhung it down the cliffs was a scrub of birches and there were many birds there and high up the cliff was a little shelf by a tree whereon they clambered to pass the night
they had had scarcely any food; it was not the time of year for berries and they had no time to go aside to snare or waylay they tramped in a hungry weary silence gnawing at twigs and leaves but over the surface of the cliffs were a multitude of snails and in a bush were the freshly laid eggs of a little bird and then ugh-lomi threw at and killed a squirrel in a beech-tree so that at last they fed well ugh-lomi watched during the night his chin on his knees; and he heard young foxes crying hard by and the noise of mammoths down the gorge and the hyænas yelling and laughing far away it was chilly but they dared not light a fire whenever he dozed his spirit went abroad and straightway met with the spirit of uya and they fought and always ugh-lomi was paralysed so that he could not smite nor run and then he would awake suddenly eudena too dreamt evil things of uya so that they both awoke with the fear of him in their hearts and by the light of the dawn they saw a woolly rhinoceros go blundering down the valley
during the day they caressed one another and were glad of the sunshine and eudenas leg was so stiff she sat on the ledge all day ugh-lomi found great flints sticking out of the cliff face greater than any he had seen and he dragged some to the ledge and began chipping so as to be armed against uya when he came again and at one he laughed heartily and eudena laughed and they threw it about in derision it had a hole in it they stuck their fingers through it it was very funny indeed then they peeped at one another through it afterwards ugh-lomi got himself a stick and thrusting by chance at this foolish flint the stick went in and stuck there he had rammed it in too tightly to withdraw it that was still stranger--scarcely funny terrible almost and for a time ugh-lomi did not greatly care to touch the thing it was as if the flint had bit and held with its teeth but then he got familiar with the odd combination he swung it about and perceived that the stick with the heavy stone on the end struck a better blow than anything he knew he went to and fro swinging it and striking with it; but later he tired of it and threw it aside in the afternoon he went up over the brow of the white cliff and lay watching by a rabbit-warren until the rabbits came out to play there were no men thereabouts and the rabbits were heedless he threw a smiting-stone he had made and got a kill
that night they made a fire from flint sparks and bracken fronds and talked and caressed by it and in their sleep uyas spirit came again and suddenly while ugh-lomi was trying to fight vainly the foolish flint on the stick came into his hand and he struck uya with it and behold it killed him but afterwards came other dreams of uya--for spirits take a lot of killing and he had to be killed again then after that the stone would not keep on the stick he awoke tired and rather gloomy and was sulky all the forenoon in spite of eudenas kindliness and instead of hunting he sat chipping a sharp edge to the singular flint and looking strangely at her then he bound the perforated flint on to the stick with strips of rabbit skin and afterwards he walked up and down the ledge striking with it and muttering to himself and thinking of uya it felt very fine and heavy in the hand
several days more than there was any counting in those days five days it may be or six did ugh-lomi and eudena stay on that shelf in the gorge of the river and they lost all fear of men and their fire burnt redly of a night and they were very merry together; there was food every day sweet water and no enemies eudenas knee was well in a couple of days for those ancient savages had quick-healing flesh indeed they were very happy
on one of those days ugh-lomi dropped a chunk of flint over the cliff he saw it fall and go bounding across the river bank into the river and after laughing and thinking it over a little he tried another this smashed a bush of hazel in the most interesting way they spent all the morning dropping stones from the ledge and in the afternoon they discovered this new and interesting pastime was also possible from the cliffbrow the next day they had forgotten this delight or at least it seemed they had forgotten
but uya came in dreams to spoil the paradise three nights he came fighting ugh-lomi in the morning after these dreams ugh-lomi would walk up and down threatening him and swinging the axe and at last came the night after ugh-lomi brained the otter and they had feasted uya went too far ugh-lomi awoke scowling under his heavy brows and he took his axe and extending his hand towards eudena he bade her wait for him upon the ledge then he clambered down the white declivity glanced up once from the foot of it and flourished his axe and without looking back again went striding along the river bank until the overhanging cliff at the bend hid him
two days and nights did eudena sit alone by the fire on the ledge waiting and in the night the beasts howled over the cliffs and down the valley and on the cliff over against her the hunched hyænas prowled black against the sky but no evil thing came near her save fear once far away she heard the roaring of a lion following the horses as they came northward over the grass lands with the spring all that time she waited--the waiting that is pain
and the third day ugh-lomi came back up the river the plumes of a raven were in his hair the first axe was red-stained and had long dark hairs upon it and he carried the necklace that had marked the favourite of uya in his hand he walked in the soft places giving no heed to his trail save a raw cut below his jaw there was not a wound upon him uya cried ugh-lomi exultant and eudena saw it was well he put the necklace on eudena and they ate and drank together and after eating he began to rehearse the whole story from the beginning when uya had cast his eyes on eudena and uya and ugh-lomi fighting in the forest had been chased by the bear eking out his scanty words with abundant pantomime springing to his feet and whirling the stone axe round when it came to the fighting the last fight was a mighty one stamping and shouting and once a blow at the fire that sent a torrent of sparks up into the night and eudena sat red in the light of the fire gloating on him her face flushed and her eyes shining and the necklace uya had made about her neck it was a splendid time and the stars that look down on us looked down on her our ancestor--who has been dead now these fifty thousand years
ii--the cave bear in the days when eudena and ugh-lomi fled from the people of uya towards the fir-clad mountains of the weald across the forests of sweet chestnut and the grass-clad chalkland and hid themselves at last in the gorge of the river between the chalk cliffs men were few and their squatting-places far between the nearest men to them were those of the tribe a full days journey down the river and up the mountains there were none man was indeed a newcomer to this part of the world in that ancient time coming slowly along the rivers generation after generation from one squatting-place to another from the south-westward and the animals that held the land the hippopotamus and rhinoceros of the river valleys the horses of the grass plains the deer and swine of the woods the grey apes in the branches the cattle of the uplands feared him but little--let alone the mammoths in the mountains and the elephants that came through the land in the summer-time out of the south for why should they fear him with but the rough chipped flints that he had not learnt to haft and which he threw but ill and the poor spear of sharpened wood as all the weapons he had against hoof and horn tooth and claw?
andoo the huge cave bear who lived in the cave up the gorge had never even seen a man in all his wise and respectable life until midway through one night as he was prowling down the gorge along the cliff edge he saw the glare of eudenas fire upon the ledge and eudena red and shining and ugh-lomi with a gigantic shadow mocking him upon the white cliff going to and fro shaking his mane of hair and waving the axe of stone--the first axe of stone--while he chanted of the killing of uya the cave bear was far up the gorge and he saw the thing slanting-ways and far off he was so surprised he stood quite still upon the edge sniffing the novel odour of burning bracken and wondering whether the dawn was coming up in the wrong place
he was the lord of the rocks and caves was the cave bear as his slighter brother the grizzly was lord of the thick woods below and as the dappled lion--the lion of those days was dappled--was lord of the thorn-thickets reed-beds and open plains he was the greatest of all meat-eaters; he knew no fear none preyed on him and none gave him battle; only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength even the mammoth shunned his country this invasion perplexed him he noticed these new beasts were shaped like monkeys and sparsely hairy like young pigs monkey and young pig said the cave bear it might not be so bad but that red thing that jumps and the black thing jumping with it yonder never in my life have i seen such things before
he came slowly along the brow of the cliff towards them stopping thrice to sniff and peer and the reek of the fire grew stronger a couple of hyænas also were so intent upon the thing below that andoo coming soft and easy was close upon them before they knew of him or he of them they started guiltily and went lurching off coming round in a wheel a hundred yards off they began yelling and calling him names to revenge themselves for the start they had had ya-ha they cried who cant grub his own burrow? who eats roots like a pig? ya-ha for even in those days the hyænas manners were just as offensive as they are now
who answers the hyæna? growled andoo peering through the midnight dimness at them and then going to look at the cliff edge
there was ugh-lomi still telling his story and the fire getting low and the scent of the burning hot and strong
andoo stood on the edge of the chalk cliff for some time shifting his vast weight from foot to foot and swaying his head to and fro with his mouth open his ears erect and twitching and the nostrils of his big black muzzle sniffing he was very curious was the cave bear more curious than any of the bears that live now and the flickering fire and the incomprehensible movements of the man let alone the intrusion into his indisputable province stirred him with a sense of strange new happenings he had been after red deer fawn that night for the cave bear was a miscellaneous hunter but this quite turned him from that enterprise
ya-ha yelled the hyænas behind ya-ha-ha
peering through the starlight andoo saw there were now three or four going to and fro against the grey hillside they will hang about me now all the night  until i kill said andoo filth of the world and mainly to annoy them he resolved to watch the red flicker in the gorge until the dawn came to drive the hyæna scum home and after a time they vanished and he heard their voices like a party of cockney beanfeasters away in the beechwoods then they came slinking near again andoo yawned and went on along the cliff and they followed then he stopped and went back
it was a splendid night beset with shining constellations the same stars but not the same constellations we know for since those days all the stars have had time to move into new places far away across the open space beyond where the heavy-shouldered lean-bodied hyænas blundered and howled was a beechwood and the mountain slopes rose beyond a dim mystery until their snow-capped summits came out white and cold and clear touched by the first rays of the yet unseen moon it was a vast silence save when the yell of the hyænas flung a vanishing discordance across its peace or when from down the hills the trumpeting of the new-come elephants came faintly on the faint breeze and below now the red flicker had dwindled and was steady and shone a deeper red and ugh-lomi had finished his story and was preparing to sleep and eudena sat and listened to the strange voices of unknown beasts and watched the dark eastern sky growing deeply luminous at the advent of the moon down below the river talked to itself and things unseen went to and fro
after a time the bear went away but in an hour he was back again then as if struck by a thought he turned and went up the gorge
the night passed and ugh-lomi slept on the waning moon rose and lit the gaunt white cliff overhead with a light that was pale and vague the gorge remained in a deeper shadow and seemed all the darker then by imperceptible degrees the day came stealing in the wake of the moonlight eudenas eyes wandered to the cliff brow overhead once and then again each time the line was sharp and clear against the sky and yet she had a dim perception of something lurking there the red of the fire grew deeper and deeper grey scales spread upon it its vertical column of smoke became more and more visible and up and down the gorge things that had been unseen grew clear in a colourless illumination she may have dozed
suddenly she started up from her squatting position erect and alert scrutinising the cliff up and down
she made the faintest sound and ugh-lomi too light-sleeping like an animal was instantly awake he caught up his axe and came noiselessly to her side
the light was still dim the world now all in black and dark grey and one sickly star still lingered overhead the ledge they were on was a little grassy space six feet wide perhaps and twenty feet long sloping outwardly and with a handful of st johns wort growing near the edge below it the soft white rock fell away in a steep slope of nearly fifty feet to the thick bush of hazel that fringed the river down the river this slope increased until some way off a thin grass held its own right up to the crest of the cliff overhead forty or fifty feet of rock bulged into the great masses characteristic of chalk but at the end of the ledge a gully a precipitous groove of discoloured rock slashed the face of the cliff and gave a footing to a scrubby growth by which eudena and ugh-lomi went up and down
they stood as noiseless as startled deer with every sense expectant for a minute they heard nothing and then came a faint rattling of dust down the gully and the creaking of twigs
ugh-lomi gripped his axe and went to the edge of the ledge for the bulge of the chalk overhead had hidden the upper part of the gully and forthwith with a sudden contraction of the heart he saw the cave bear half-way down from the brow and making a gingerly backward step with his flat hind-foot his hind-quarters were towards ugh-lomi and he clawed at the rocks and bushes so that he seemed flattened against the cliff he looked none the less for that from his shining snout to his stumpy tail he was a lion and a half the length of two tall men he looked over his shoulder and his huge mouth was open with the exertion of holding up his great carcase and his tongue lay out
he got his footing and came down slowly a yard nearer
bear said ugh-lomi looking round with his face white
but eudena with terror in her eyes was pointing down the cliff
ugh-lomis mouth fell open for down below with her big fore-feet against the rock stood another big brown-grey bulk--the she-bear she was not so big as andoo but she was big enough for all that
then suddenly ugh-lomi gave a cry and catching up a handful of the litter of ferns that lay scattered on the ledge he thrust it into the pallid ash of the fire brother fire he cried brother fire and eudena starting into activity did likewise brother fire help help brother fire
brother fire was still red in his heart but he turned to grey as they scattered him brother fire they screamed but he whispered and passed and there was nothing but ashes then ugh-lomi danced with anger and struck the ashes with his fist but eudena began to hammer the firestone against a flint and the eyes of each were turning ever and again towards the gully by which andoo was climbing down brother fire
suddenly the huge furry hind-quarters of the bear came into view beneath the bulge of the chalk that had hidden him he was still clambering gingerly down the nearly vertical surface his head was yet out of sight but they could hear him talking to himself pig and monkey said the cave bear it ought to be good
eudena struck a spark and blew at it; it twinkled brighter and then--went out at that she cast down flint and firestone and stared blankly then she sprang to her feet and scrambled a yard or so up the cliff above the ledge how she hung on even for a moment i do not know for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey in a couple of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with bleeding hands
ugh-lomi was making frantic rushes about the ledge--now he would go to the edge now to the gully he did not know what to do he could not think the she-bear looked smaller than her mate--much if they rushed down on her together _one_ might live ugh? said the cave bear and ugh-lomi turned again and saw his little eyes peering under the bulge of the chalk
eudena cowering at the end of the ledge began to scream like a gripped rabbit
at that a sort of madness came upon ugh-lomi with a mighty cry he caught up his axe and ran towards andoo the monster gave a grunt of surprise in a moment ugh-lomi was clinging to a bush right underneath the bear and in another he was hanging to its back half buried in fur with one fist clutched in the hair under its jaw the bear was too astonished at this fantastic attack to do more than cling passive and then the axe the first of all axes rang on its skull
the bears head twisted from side to side and he began a petulant scolding growl the axe bit within an inch of the left eye and the hot blood blinded that side at that the brute roared with surprise and anger and his teeth gnashed six inches from ugh-lomis face then the axe clubbed close came down heavily on the corner of the jaw
the next blow blinded the right side and called forth a roar this time of pain eudena saw the huge flat feet slipping and sliding and suddenly the bear gave a clumsy leap sideways as if for the ledge then everything vanished and the hazels smashed and a roar of pain and a tumult of shouts and growls came up from far below
eudena screamed and ran to the edge and peered over for a moment man and bears were a heap together ugh-lomi uppermost; and then he had sprung clear and was scaling the gully again with the bears rolling and striking at one another among the hazels but he had left his axe below and three knob-ended streaks of carmine were shooting down his thigh up he cried and in a moment eudena was leading the way to the top of the cliff
in half a minute they were at the crest their hearts pumping noisily with andoo and his wife far and safe below them andoo was sitting on his haunches both paws at work trying with quick exasperated movements to wipe the blindness out of his eyes and the she-bear stood on all-fours a little way off ruffled in appearance and growling angrily ugh-lomi flung himself flat on the grass and lay panting and bleeding with his face on his arms
for a second eudena regarded the bears then she came and sat beside him looking at him
presently she put forth her hand timidly and touched him and made the guttural sound that was his name he turned over and raised himself on his arm his face was pale like the face of one who is afraid he looked at her steadfastly for a moment and then suddenly he laughed waugh he said exultantly
waugh said she--a simple but expressive conversation
then ugh-lomi came and knelt beside her and on hands and knees peered over the brow and examined the gorge his breath was steady now and the blood on his leg had ceased to flow though the scratches the she-bear had made were open and wide he squatted up and sat staring at the footmarks of the great bear as they came to the gully--they were as wide as his head and twice as long then he jumped up and went along the cliff face until the ledge was visible here he sat down for some time thinking while eudena watched him presently she saw the bears had gone
at last ugh-lomi rose as one whose mind is made up he returned towards the gully eudena keeping close by him and together they clambered to the ledge they took the firestone and a flint and then ugh-lomi went down to the foot of the cliff very cautiously and found his axe they returned to the cliff as quietly as they could and set off at a brisk walk the ledge was a home no longer with such callers in the neighbourhood ugh-lomi carried the axe and eudena the firestone so simple was a palæolithic removal
they went up-stream although it might lead to the very lair of the cave bear because there was no other way to go down the stream was the tribe and had not ugh-lomi killed uya and wau? by the stream they had to keep--because of drinking
so they marched through beech trees with the gorge deepening until the river flowed a frothing rapid five hundred feet below them of all the changeful things in this world of change the courses of rivers in deep valleys change least it was the river wey the river we know to-day and they marched over the very spots where nowadays stand little guildford and godalming--the first human beings to come into the land once a grey ape chattered and vanished and all along the cliff edge vast and even ran the spoor of the great cave bear
and then the spoor of the bear fell away from the cliff showing ugh-lomi thought that he came from some place to the left and keeping to the cliffs edge they presently came to an end they found themselves looking down on a great semi-circular space caused by the collapse of the cliff it had smashed right across the gorge banking the up-stream water back in a pool which overflowed in a rapid the slip had happened long ago it was grassed over but the face of the cliffs that stood about the semicircle was still almost fresh-looking and white as on the day when the rock must have broken and slid down starkly exposed and black under the foot of these cliffs were the mouths of several caves and as they stood there looking at the space and disinclined to skirt it because they thought the bears lair lay somewhere on the left in the direction they must needs take they saw suddenly first one bear and then two coming up the grass slope to the right and going across the amphitheatre towards the caves andoo was first; he dropped a little on his fore-foot and his mien was despondent and the she-bear came shuffling behind
eudena and ugh-lomi stepped back from the cliff until they could just see the bears over the verge then ugh-lomi stopped eudena pulled his arm but he turned with a forbidding gesture and her hand dropped ugh-lomi stood watching the bears with his axe in his hand until they had vanished into the cave he growled softly and shook the axe at the she-bears receding quarters then to eudenas terror instead of creeping off with her he lay flat down and crawled forward into such a position that he could just see the cave it was bears--and he did it as calmly as if it had been rabbits he was watching
he lay still like a barked log sun-dappled in the shadow of the trees he was thinking and eudena had learnt even when a little girl that when ugh-lomi became still like that jaw-bone on fist novel things presently began to happen
it was an hour before the thinking was over; it was noon when the two little savages had found their way to the cliff brow that overhung the bears cave and all the long afternoon they fought desperately with a great boulder of chalk; trundling it with nothing but their unaided sturdy muscles from the gully where it had hung like a loose tooth towards the cliff top it was full two yards about it stood as high as eudenas waist it was obtuse-angled and toothed with flints and when the sun set it was poised three inches from the edge above the cave of the great cave bear
in the cave conversation languished during that afternoon the she-bear snoozed sulkily in her corner--for she was fond of pig and monkey--and andoo was busy licking the side of his paw and smearing his face to cool the smart and inflammation of his wounds afterwards he went and sat just within the mouth of the cave blinking out at the afternoon sun with his uninjured eye and thinking
i never was so startled in my life he said at last they are the most extraordinary beasts attacking _me_
i dont like them said the she-bear out of the darkness behind
a feebler sort of beast i _never_ saw i cant think what the world is coming to scraggy weedy legs wonder how they keep warm in winter?
very likely they dont said the she-bear
i suppose its a sort of monkey gone wrong
its a change said the she-bear
a pause the advantage he had was merely accidental said andoo these things _will_ happen at times
_i_ cant understand why you let go said the she-bear
that matter had been discussed before and settled so andoo being a bear of experience remained silent for a space then he resumed upon a different aspect of the matter he has a sort of claw--a long claw that he seemed to have first on one paw and then on the other just one claw theyre very odd things the bright thing too they seemed to have--like that glare that comes in the sky in daytime--only it jumps about--its really worth seeing its a thing with a root too--like grass when it is windy
does it bite? asked the she-bear if it bites it cant be a plant
no----i dont know said andoo but its curious anyhow
i wonder if they _are_ good eating? said the she-bear
they look it said andoo with appetite--for the cave bear like the polar bear was an incurable carnivore--no roots or honey for _him_
the two bears fell into a meditation for a space then andoo resumed his simple attentions to his eye the sunlight up the green slope before the cave mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer until it was a ruddy amber
curious sort of thing--day said the cave bear lot too much of it i think quite unsuitable for hunting dazzles me always i cant smell nearly so well by day
the she-bear did not answer but there came a measured crunching sound out of the darkness she had turned up a bone andoo yawned well he said he strolled to the cave mouth and stood with his head projecting surveying the amphitheatre he found he had to turn his head completely round to see objects on his right-hand side no doubt that eye would be all right to-morrow
he yawned again there was a tap overhead and a big mass of chalk flew out from the cliff face dropped a yard in front of his nose and starred into a dozen unequal fragments it startled him extremely
when he had recovered a little from his shock he went and sniffed curiously at the representative pieces of the fallen projectile they had a distinctive flavour oddly reminiscent of the two drab animals of the ledge he sat up and pawed the larger lump and walked round it several times trying to find a man about it somewhere
when night had come he went off down the river gorge to see if he could cut off either of the ledges occupants the ledge was empty there were no signs of the red thing but as he was rather hungry he did not loiter long that night but pushed on to pick up a red deer fawn he forgot about the drab animals he found a fawn but the doe was close by and made an ugly fight for her young andoo had to leave the fawn but as her blood was up she stuck to the attack and at last he got in a blow of his paw on her nose and so got hold of her more meat but less delicacy and the she-bear following had her share the next afternoon curiously enough the very fellow of the first white rock fell and smashed precisely according to precedent
the aim of the third that fell the night after however was better it hit andoos unspeculative skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff and the white fragments went dancing to all the points of the compass the she-bear coming after him and sniffing curiously at him found him lying in an odd sort of attitude with his head wet and all out of shape she was a young she-bear and inexperienced and having sniffed about him for some time and licked him a little and so forth she decided to leave him until the odd mood had passed and went on her hunting alone
she looked up the fawn of the red doe they had killed two nights ago and found it but it was lonely hunting without andoo and she returned caveward before dawn the sky was grey and overcast the trees up the gorge were black and unfamiliar and into her ursine mind came a dim sense of strange and dreary happenings she lifted up her voice and called andoo by name the sides of the gorge re-echoed her
as she approached the caves she saw in the half light and heard a couple of jackals scuttle off and immediately after a hyæna howled and a dozen clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope and stopped and yelled derision lord of the rocks and caves--ya-ha came down the wind the dismal feeling in the she-bears mind became suddenly acute she shuffled across the amphitheatre
ya-ha said the hyænas retreating ya-ha
the cave bear was not lying quite in the same attitude because the hyænas had been busy and in one place his ribs showed white dotted over the turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the three great lumps of chalk and the air was full of the scent of death
the she-bear stopped dead even now that the great and wonderful andoo was killed was beyond her believing then she heard far overhead a sound a queer sound a little like the shout of a hyæna but fuller and lower in pitch she looked up her little dawn-blinded eyes seeing little her nostrils quivering and there on the cliff edge far above her against the bright pink of dawn were two little shaggy round dark things the heads of eudena and ugh-lomi as they shouted derision at her but though she could not see them very distinctly she could hear and dimly she began to apprehend a novel feeling as of imminent strange evils came into her heart
she began to examine the smashed fragments of chalk that lay about andoo for a space she stood still looking about her and making a low continuous sound that was almost a moan then she went back incredulously to andoo to make one last effort to rouse him
iii--the first horseman in the days before ugh-lomi there was little trouble between the horses and men they lived apart--the men in the river swamps and thickets the horses on the wide grassy uplands between the chestnuts and the pines sometimes a pony would come straying into the clogging marshes to make a flint-hacked meal and sometimes the tribe would find one the kill of a lion and drive off the jackals and feast heartily while the sun was high these horses of the old time were clumsy at the fetlock and dun-coloured with a rough tail and big head they came every spring-time north-westward into the country after the swallows and before the hippopotami as the grass on the wide downland stretches grew long they came only in small bodies thus far each herd a stallion and two or three mares and a foal or so having its own stretch of country and they went again when the chestnut-trees were yellow and the wolves came down the wealden mountains
it was their custom to graze right out in the open going into cover only in the heat of the day they avoided the long stretches of thorn and beechwood preferring an isolated group of trees void of ambuscade so that it was hard to come upon them they were never fighters; their heels and teeth were for one another but in the clear country once they were started no living thing came near them though perhaps the elephant might have done so had he felt the need and in those days man seemed a harmless thing enough no whisper of prophetic intelligence told the species of the terrible slavery that was to come of the whip and spur and bearing-rein the clumsy load and the slippery street the insufficient food and the knackers yard that was to replace the wide grass-land and the freedom of the earth
down in the wey marshes ugh-lomi and eudena had never seen the horses closely but now they saw them every day as the two of them raided out from their lair on the ledge in the gorge raiding together in search of food they had returned to the ledge after the killing of andoo; for of the she-bear they were not afraid the she-bear had become afraid of them and when she winded them she went aside the two went together everywhere; for since they had left the tribe eudena was not so much ugh-lomis woman as his mate; she learnt to hunt even--as much that is as any woman could she was indeed a marvellous woman he would lie for hours watching a beast or planning catches in that shock head of his and she would stay beside him with her bright eyes upon him offering no irritating suggestions--as still as any man a wonderful woman
at the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn and then beechwoods and going through the beechwoods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy expanse and in sight of the horses here on the edge of the wood and bracken were the rabbit-burrows and here among the fronds eudena and ugh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready until the little people came out to nibble and play in the sunset and while eudena would sit a silent figure of watchfulness regarding the burrows ugh-lomis eyes were ever away across the greensward at those wonderful grazing strangers
in a dim way he appreciated their grace and their supple nimbleness as the sun declined in the evening-time and the heat of the day passed they would become active would start chasing one another neighing dodging shaking their manes coming round in great curves sometimes so close that the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thunder it looked so fine that ugh-lomi wanted to join in badly and sometimes one would roll over on the turf kicking four hoofs heavenward which seemed formidable and was certainly much less alluring
dim imaginings ran through ugh-lomis mind as he watched--by virtue of which two rabbits lived the longer and sleeping his brains were clearer and bolder--for that was the way in those days he came near the horses he dreamt and fought smiting-stone against hoof but then the horses changed to men or at least to men with horses heads and he awoke in a cold sweat of terror
yet the next day in the morning as the horses were grazing one of the mares whinnied and they saw ugh-lomi coming up the wind they all stopped their eating and watched him ugh-lomi was not coming towards them but strolling obliquely across the open looking at anything in the world but horses he had stuck three fern-fronds into the mat of his hair giving him a remarkable appearance and he walked very slowly whats up now? said the master horse who was capable but inexperienced
it looks more like the first half of an animal than anything else in the world he said fore-legs and no hind
its only one of those pink monkey things said the eldest mare theyre a sort of river monkey theyre quite common on the plains
ugh-lomi continued his oblique advance the eldest mare was struck with the want of motive in his proceedings
fool said the eldest mare in a quick conclusive way she had she resumed her grazing the master horse and the second mare followed suit
look hes nearer said the foal with a stripe
one of the younger foals made uneasy movements ugh-lomi squatted down and sat regarding the horses fixedly in a little while he was satisfied that they meant neither flight nor hostilities he began to consider his next procedure he did not feel anxious to kill but he had his axe with him and the spirit of sport was upon him how would one kill one of these creatures?--these great beautiful creatures
eudena watching him with a fearful admiration from the cover of the bracken saw him presently go on all fours and so proceed again but the horses preferred him a biped to a quadruped and the master horse threw up his head and gave the word to move ugh-lomi thought they were off for good but after a minutes gallop they came round in a wide curve and stood winding him then as a rise in the ground hid him they tailed out the master horse leading and approached him spirally
he was as ignorant of the possibilities of a horse as they were of his and at this stage it would seem he funked he knew this kind of stalking would make red deer or buffalo charge if it were persisted in at any rate eudena saw him jump up and come walking towards her with the fern plumes held in his hand
she stood up and he grinned to show that the whole thing was an immense lark and that what he had done was just what he had planned to do from the very beginning so that incident ended but he was very thoughtful all that day
the next day this foolish drab creature with the leonine mane instead of going about the grazing or hunting he was made for was prowling round the horses again the eldest mare was all for silent contempt i suppose he wants to learn something from us she said and _let_ him the next day he was at it again the master horse decided he meant absolutely nothing but as a matter of fact ugh-lomi the first of men to feel that curious spell of the horse that binds us even to this day meant a great deal he admired them unreservedly there was a rudiment of the snob in him i am afraid and he wanted to be near these beautifully-curved animals then there were vague conceptions of a kill if only they would let him come near them but they drew the line he found at fifty yards if he came nearer than that they moved off--with dignity i suppose it was the way he had blinded andoo that made him think of leaping on the back of one of them but though eudena after a time came out in the open too and they did some unobtrusive stalking things stopped there
then one memorable day a new idea came to ugh-lomi the horse looks down and level but he does not look up no animals look up--they have too much common-sense it was only that fantastic creature man could waste his wits skyward ugh-lomi made no philosophical deductions but he perceived the thing was so so he spent a weary day in a beech that stood in the open while eudena stalked usually the horses went into the shade in the heat of the afternoon but that day the sky was overcast and they would not in spite of eudenas solicitude
it was two days after that that ugh-lomi had his desire the day was blazing hot and the multiplying flies asserted themselves the horses stopped grazing before midday and came into the shadow below him and stood in couples nose to tail flapping
the master horse by virtue of his heels came closest to the tree and suddenly there was a rustle and a creak a _thud_ then a sharp chipped flint bit him on the cheek the master horse stumbled came on one knee rose to his feet and was off like the wind the air was full of the whirl of limbs the prance of hoofs and snorts of alarm ugh-lomi was pitched a foot in the air came down again up again his stomach was hit violently and then his knees got a grip of something between them he found himself clutching with knees feet and hands careering violently with extraordinary oscillation through the air--his axe gone heaven knows whither hold tight said mother instinct and he did
he was aware of a lot of coarse hair in his face some of it between his teeth and of green turf streaming past in front of his eyes he saw the shoulder of the master horse vast and sleek with the muscles flowing swiftly under the skin he perceived that his arms were round the neck and that the violent jerkings he experienced had a sort of rhythm
then he was in the midst of a wild rush of tree-stems and then there were fronds of bracken about and then more open turf then a stream of pebbles rushing past little pebbles flying sideways athwart the stream from the blow of the swift hoofs ugh-lomi began to feel frightfully sick and giddy but he was not the stuff to leave go simply because he was uncomfortable
he dared not leave his grip but he tried to make himself more comfortable he released his hug on the neck gripping the mane instead he slipped his knees forward and pushing back came into a sitting position where the quarters broaden it was nervous work but he managed it and at last he was fairly seated astride breathless indeed and uncertain but with that frightful pounding of his body at any rate relieved
slowly the fragments of ugh-lomis mind got into order again the pace seemed to him terrific but a kind of exultation was beginning to oust his first frantic terror the air rushed by sweet and wonderful the rhythm of the hoofs changed and broke up and returned into itself again they were on turf now a wide glade--the beech-trees a hundred yards away on either side and a succulent band of green starred with pink blossom and shot with silver water here and there meandered down the middle far off was a glimpse of blue valley--far away the exultation grew it was mans first taste of pace
then came a wide space dappled with flying fallow deer scattering this way and that and then a couple of jackals mistaking ugh-lomi for a lion came hurrying after him and when they saw it was not a lion they still came on out of curiosity on galloped the horse with his one idea of escape and after him the jackals with pricked ears and quickly-barked remarks which kills which? said the first jackal its the horse being killed said the second they gave the howl of following and the horse answered to it as a horse answers nowadays to the spur
on they rushed a little tornado through the quiet day putting up startled birds sending a dozen unexpected things darting to cover raising a myriad of indignant dung-flies smashing little blossoms flowering complacently back into their parental turf trees again and then splash splash across a torrent; then a hare shot out of a tuft of grass under the very hoofs of the master horse and the jackals left them incontinently so presently they broke into the open again a wide expanse of turfy hillside--the very grassy downs that fall northward nowadays from the epsom stand
the first hot bolt of the master horse was long since over he was falling into a measured trot and ugh-lomi albeit bruised exceedingly and quite uncertain of the future was in a state of glorious enjoyment and now came a new development the pace broke again the master horse came round on a short curve and stopped dead
ugh-lomi became alert he wished he had a flint but the throwing-flint he had carried in a thong about his waist was--like the axe--heaven knows where the master horse turned his head and ugh-lomi became aware of an eye and teeth he whipped his leg into a position of security and hit at the cheek with his fist then the head went down somewhere out of existence apparently and the back he was sitting on flew up into a dome ugh-lomi became a thing of instinct again--strictly prehensile; he held by knees and feet and his head seemed sliding towards the turf his fingers were twisted into the shock of mane and the rough hair of the horse saved him the gradient he was on lowered again and then--whup said ugh-lomi astonished and the slant was the other way up but ugh-lomi was a thousand generations nearer the primordial than man: no monkey could have held on better and the lion had been training the horse for countless generations against the tactics of rolling and rearing back but he kicked like a master and buck-jumped rather neatly in five minutes ugh-lomi lived a lifetime if he came off the horse would kill him he felt assured
then the master horse decided to stick to his old tactics again and suddenly went off at a gallop he headed down the slope taking the steep places at a rush swerving neither to the right nor to the left and as they rode down the wide expanse of valley sank out of sight behind the approaching skirmishers of oak and hawthorn they skirted a sudden hollow with the pool of a spring rank weeds and silver bushes the ground grew softer and the grass taller and on the right-hand side and the left came scattered bushes of may--still splashed with belated blossom presently the bushes thickened until they lashed the passing rider and little flashes and gouts of blood came out on horse and man then the way opened again
and then came a wonderful adventure a sudden squeal of unreasonable anger rose amidst the bushes the squeal of some creature bitterly wronged and crashing after them appeared a big grey-blue shape it was yaaa the big-horned rhinoceros in one of those fits of fury of his charging full tilt after the manner of his kind he had been startled at his feeding and someone it did not matter who was to be ripped and trampled therefore he was bearing down on them from the left with his wicked little eye red his great horn down and his tail like a jury-mast behind him for a minute ugh-lomi was minded to slip off and dodge and then behold the staccato of the hoofs grew swifter and the rhinoceros and his stumpy hurrying little legs seemed to slide out at the back corner of ugh-lomis eye in two minutes they were through the bushes of may and out in the open going fast for a space he could hear the ponderous paces in pursuit receding behind him and then it was just as if yaaa had not lost his temper as if yaaa had never existed
the pace never faltered on they rode and on
ugh-lomi was now all exultation to exult in those days was to insult ya-ha big nose he said trying to crane back and see some remote speck of a pursuer why dont you carry your smiting-stone in your fist? he ended with a frantic whoop
but that whoop was unfortunate for coming close to the ear of the horse and being quite unexpected it startled the stallion extremely he shied violently ugh-lomi suddenly found himself uncomfortable again he was hanging on to the horse he found by one arm and one knee
the rest of the ride was honourable but unpleasant the view was chiefly of blue sky and that was combined with the most unpleasant physical sensations finally a bush of thorn lashed him and he let go
he hit the ground with his cheek and shoulder and then after a complicated and extraordinarily rapid movement hit it again with the end of his backbone he saw splashes and sparks of light and colour the ground seemed bouncing about just like the horse had done then he found he was sitting on turf six yards beyond the bush in front of him was a space of grass growing greener and greener and a number of human beings in the distance and the horse was going round at a smart gallop quite a long way off to the right
the human beings were on the opposite side of the river some still in the water but they were all running away as hard as they could go the advent of a monster that took to pieces was not the sort of novelty they cared for for quite a minute ugh-lomi sat regarding them in a purely spectacular spirit the bend of the river the knoll among the reeds and royal ferns the thin streams of smoke going up to heaven were all perfectly familiar to him it was the squatting-place of the sons of uya of uya from whom he had fled with eudena and whom he had waylaid in the chestnut woods and killed with the first axe
he rose to his feet still dazed from his fall and as he did so the scattering fugitives turned and regarded him some pointed to the receding horse and chattered he walked slowly towards them staring he forgot the horse he forgot his own bruises in the growing interest of this encounter there were fewer of them than there had been--he supposed the others must have hid--the heap of fern for the night fire was not so high by the flint heaps should have sat wau--but then he remembered he had killed wau suddenly brought back to this familiar scene the gorge and the bears and eudena seemed things remote things dreamt of
he stopped at the bank and stood regarding the tribe his mathematical abilities were of the slightest but it was certain there were fewer the men might be away but there were fewer women and children he gave the shout of home-coming his quarrel had been with uya and wau--not with the others children of uya he cried they answered with his name a little fearfully because of the strange way he had come
for a space they spoke together then an old woman lifted a shrill voice and answered him our lord is a lion
ugh-lomi did not understand that saying they answered him again several together uya comes again he comes as a lion our lord is a lion he comes at night he slays whom he will but none other may slay us ugh-lomi none other may slay us
still ugh-lomi did not understand our lord is a lion he speaks no more to men
ugh-lomi stood regarding them he had had dreams--he knew that though he had killed uya uya still existed and now they told him uya was a lion
the shrivelled old woman the mistress of the fire-minders suddenly turned and spoke softly to those next to her she was a very old woman indeed she had been the first of uyas wives and he had let her live beyond the age to which it is seemly a woman should be permitted to live she had been cunning from the first cunning to please uya and to get food and now she was great in counsel she spoke softly and ugh-lomi watched her shrivelled form across the river with a curious distaste then she called aloud come over to us ugh-lomi
a girl suddenly lifted up her voice come over to us ugh-lomi she said and they all began crying come over to us ugh-lomi
it was strange how their manner changed after the old woman called
he stood quite still watching them all it was pleasant to be called and the girl who had called first was a pretty one but she made him think of eudena
come over to us ugh-lomi they cried and the voice of the shrivelled old woman rose above them all at the sound of her voice his hesitation returned
he stood on the river bank ugh-lomi--ugh the thinker--with his thoughts slowly taking shape presently one and then another paused to see what he would do he was minded to go back he was minded not to suddenly his fear or his caution got the upper hand without answering them he turned and walked back towards the distant thorn-trees the way he had come forthwith the whole tribe started crying to him again very eagerly he hesitated and turned then he went on then he turned again and then once again regarding them with troubled eyes as they called the last time he took two paces back before his fear stopped him they saw him stop once more and suddenly shake his head and vanish among the hawthorn-trees
then all the women and children lifted up their voices together and called to him in one last vain effort
far down the river the reeds were stirring in the breeze where convenient for his new sort of feeding the old lion who had taken to man-eating had made his lair
the old woman turned her face that way and pointed to the hawthorn thickets uya she screamed there goes thine enemy there goes thine enemy uya why do you devour us nightly? we have tried to snare him there goes thine enemy uya
but the lion who preyed upon the tribe was taking his siesta the cry went unheard that day he had dined on one of the plumper girls and his mood was a comfortable placidity he really did not understand that he was uya or that ugh-lomi was his enemy
so it was that ugh-lomi rode the horse and heard first of uya the lion who had taken the place of uya the master and was eating up the tribe and as he hurried back to the gorge his mind was no longer full of the horse but of the thought that uya was still alive to slay or be slain over and over again he saw the shrunken band of women and children crying that uya was a lion uya was a lion
and presently fearing the twilight might come upon him ugh-lomi began running
iv--uya the lion the old lion was in luck the tribe had a certain pride in their ruler but that was all the satisfaction they got out of it he came the very night that ugh-lomi killed uya the cunning and so it was they named him uya it was the old woman the fire-minder who first named him uya a shower had lowered the fires to a glow and made the night dark and as they conversed together and peered at one another in the darkness and wondered fearfully what uya would do to them in their dreams now that he was dead they heard the mounting reverberations of the lions roar close at hand then everything was still
they held their breath so that almost the only sounds were the patter of the rain and the hiss of the raindrops in the ashes and then after an interminable time a crash and a shriek of fear and a growling they sprang to their feet shouting screaming running this way and that but brands would not burn and in a minute the victim was being dragged away through the ferns it was irk the brother of wau
so the lion came the ferns were still wet from the rain the next night and he came and took click with the red hair that sufficed for two nights and then in the dark between the moons he came three nights night after night and that though they had good fires he was an old lion with stumpy teeth but very silent and very cool; he knew of fires before; these were not the first of mankind that had ministered to his old age the third night he came between the outer fire and the inner and he leapt the flint heap and pulled down irm the son of irk who had seemed like to be the leader that was a dreadful night because they lit great flares of fern and ran screaming and the lion missed his hold of irm by the glare of the fire they saw irm struggle up and run a little way towards them and then the lion in two bounds had him down again that was the last of irm
so fear came and all the delight of spring passed out of their lives already there were five gone out of the tribe and four nights added three more to the number food-seeking became spiritless none knew who might go next and all day the women toiled even the favourite women gathering litter and sticks for the night fires and the hunters hunted ill: in the warm spring-time hunger came again as though it was still winter the tribe might have moved had they had a leader but they had no leader and none knew where to go that the lion could not follow them so the old lion waxed fat and thanked heaven for the kindly race of men two of the children and a youth died while the moon was still new and then it was the shrivelled old fire-minder first bethought herself in a dream of eudena and ugh-lomi and of the way uya had been slain she had lived in fear of uya all her days and now she lived in fear of the lion that ugh-lomi could kill uya for good--ugh-lomi whom she had seen born--was impossible it was uya still seeking his enemy
and then came the strange return of ugh-lomi a wonderful animal seen galloping far across the river that suddenly changed into two animals a horse and a man following this portent the vision of ugh-lomi on the farther bank of the river yes it was all plain to her uya was punishing them because they had not hunted down ugh-lomi and eudena
the men came straggling back to the chances of the night while the sun was still golden in the sky they were received with the story of ugh-lomi she went across the river with them and showed them his spoor hesitating on the farther bank siss the tracker knew the feet for ugh-lomis uya needs ugh-lomi cried the old woman standing on the left of the bend a gesticulating figure of flaring bronze in the sunset her cries were strange sounds flitting to and fro on the borderland of speech but this was the sense they carried: the lion needs eudena he comes night after night seeking eudena and ugh-lomi when he cannot find eudena and ugh-lomi he grows angry and he kills hunt eudena and ugh-lomi eudena whom he pursued and ugh-lomi for whom he gave the death-word hunt eudena and ugh-lomi
she turned to the distant reed-bed as sometimes she had turned to uya in his life is it not so my lord? she cried and as if in answer the tall reeds bowed before a breath of wind
far into the twilight the sound of hacking was heard from the squatting-places it was the men sharpening their ashen spears against the hunting of the morrow and in the night early before the moon rose the lion came and took the girl of siss the tracker
in the morning before the sun had risen siss the tracker and the lad wau-hau who now chipped flints and one eye and bo and the snail-eater the two red-haired men and cats-skin and snake all the men that were left alive of the sons of uya taking their ash spears and their smiting-stones and with throwing-stones in the beast-paw bags started forth upon the trail of ugh-lomi through the hawthorn thickets where yaaa the rhinoceros and his brothers were feeding and up the bare downland towards the beechwoods
that night the fires burnt high and fierce as the waxing moon set and the lion left the crouching women and children in peace
and the next day while the sun was still high the hunters returned--all save one eye who lay dead with a smashed skull at the foot of the ledge (when ugh-lomi came back that evening from stalking the horses he found the vultures already busy over him) and with them the hunters brought eudena bruised and wounded but alive that had been the strange order of the shrivelled old woman that she was to be brought alive--she is no kill for us she is for uya the lion her hands were tied with thongs as though she had been a man and she came weary and drooping--her hair over her eyes and matted with blood they walked about her and ever and again the snail-eater whose name she had given would laugh and strike her with his ashen spear and after he had struck her with his spear he would look over his shoulder like one who had done an over-bold deed the others too looked over their shoulders ever and again and all were in a hurry save eudena when the old woman saw them coming she cried aloud with joy
they made eudena cross the river with her hands tied although the current was strong and when she slipped the old woman screamed first with joy and then for fear she might be drowned and when they had dragged eudena to shore she could not stand for a time albeit they beat her sore so they let her sit with her feet touching the water and her eyes staring before her and her face set whatever they might do or say all the tribe came down to the squatting-place even curly little haha who as yet could scarcely toddle and stood staring at eudena and the old woman as now we should stare at some strange wounded beast and its captor
the old woman tore off the necklace of uya that was about eudenas neck and put it on herself--she had been the first to wear it then she tore at eudenas hair and took a spear from siss and beat her with all her might and when she had vented the warmth of her heart on the girl she looked closely into her face eudenas eyes were closed and her features were set and she lay so still that for a moment the old woman feared she was dead and then her nostrils quivered at that the old woman slapped her face and laughed and gave the spear to siss again and went a little way off from her and began to talk and jeer at her after her manner
the old woman had more words than any in the tribe and her talk was a terrible thing to hear sometimes she screamed and moaned incoherently and sometimes the shape of her guttural cries was the mere phantom of thoughts but she conveyed to eudena nevertheless much of the things that were yet to come of the lion and of the torment he would do her and ugh-lomi ha ha ugh-lomi is slain?
and suddenly eudenas eyes opened and she sat up again and her look met the old womans fair and level no she said slowly like one trying to remember i did not see my ugh-lomi slain i did not see my ugh-lomi slain
tell her cried the old woman tell her--he that killed him tell her how ugh-lomi was slain
she looked and all the women and children there looked from man to man
none answered her they stood shame-faced
tell her said the old woman the men looked at one another
eudenas face suddenly lit tell her she said tell her mighty men tell her the killing of ugh-lomi
the old woman rose and struck her sharply across her mouth
we could not find ugh-lomi said siss the tracker slowly who hunts two kills none
then eudenas heart leapt but she kept her face hard it was as well for the old woman looked at her sharply with murder in her eyes
then the old woman turned her tongue upon the men because they had feared to go on after ugh-lomi she dreaded no one now uya was slain she scolded them as one scolds children and they scowled at her and began to accuse one another until suddenly siss the tracker raised his voice and bade her hold her peace
and so when the sun was setting they took eudena and went--though their hearts sank within them--along the trail the old lion had made in the reeds all the men went together at one place was a group of alders and here they hastily bound eudena where the lion might find her when he came abroad in the twilight and having done so they hurried back until they were near the squatting-place then they stopped siss stopped first and looked back again at the alders they could see her head even from the squatting-place a little black shock under the limb of the larger tree that was as well
all the women and children stood watching upon the crest of the mound and the old woman stood and screamed for the lion to take her whom he sought and counselled him on the torments he might do her
eudena was very weary now stunned by beatings and fatigue and sorrow and only the fear of the thing that was still to come upheld her the sun was broad and blood-red between the stems of the distant chestnuts and the west was all on fire; the evening breeze had died to a warm tranquillity the air was full of midge swarms the fish in the river hard by would leap at times and now and again a cockchafer would drone through the air out of the corner of her eye eudena could see a part of the squatting-knoll and little figures standing and staring at her and--a very little sound but very clear--she could hear the beating of the firestone dark and near to her and still was the reed-fringed thicket of the lair
presently the firestone ceased she looked for the sun and found he had gone and overhead and growing brighter was the waxing moon she looked towards the thicket of the lair seeking shapes in the reeds and then suddenly she began to wriggle and wriggle weeping and calling upon ugh-lomi
but ugh-lomi was far away when they saw her head moving with her struggles they shouted together on the knoll and she desisted and was still and then came the bats and the star that was like ugh-lomi crept out of its blue hiding-place in the west she called to it but softly because she feared the lion and all through the coming of the twilight the thicket was still
so the dark crept upon eudena and the moon grew bright and the shadows of things that had fled up the hillside and vanished with the evening came back to them short and black and the dark shapes in the thicket of reeds and alders where the lion lay gathered and a faint stir began there but nothing came out therefrom all through the gathering of the darkness
she looked at the squatting-place and saw the fires glowing smoky-red and the men and women going to and fro the other way over the river a white mist was rising then far away came the whimpering of young foxes and the yell of a hyæna
there were long gaps of aching waiting after a long time some animal splashed in the water and seemed to cross the river at the ford beyond the lair but what animal it was she could not see from the distant drinking-pools she could hear the sound of splashing and the noise of elephants--so still was the night
the earth was now a colourless arrangement of white reflections and impenetrable shadows under the blue sky the silvery moon was already spotted with the filigree crests of the chestnut woods and over the shadowy eastward hills the stars were multiplying the knoll fires were bright red now and black figures stood waiting against them they were waiting for a scream surely it would be soon
the night suddenly seemed full of movement she held her breath things were passing--one two three--subtly sneaking shadows jackals
then a long waiting again then asserting itself as real at once over all the sounds her mind had imagined came a stir in the thicket then a vigorous movement there was a snap the reeds crashed heavily once twice thrice and then everything was still save a measured swishing she heard a low tremulous growl and then everything was still again the stillness lengthened--would it never end? she held her breath; she bit her lips to stop screaming then something scuttled through the undergrowth her scream was involuntary she did not hear the answering yell from the mound
immediately the thicket woke up to vigorous movement again she saw the grass stems waving in the light of the setting moon the alders swaying she struggled violently--her last struggle but nothing came towards her a dozen monsters seemed rushing about in that little place for a couple of minutes and then again came silence the moon sank behind the distant chestnuts and the night was dark
then an odd sound a sobbing panting that grew faster and fainter yet another silence and then dim sounds and the grunting of some animal
everything was still again far away eastwards an elephant trumpeted and from the woods came a snarling and yelping that died away
in the long interval the moon shone out again between the stems of the trees on the ridge sending two great bars of light and a bar of darkness across the reedy waste then came a steady rustling a splash and the reeds swayed wider and wider apart and at last they broke open cleft from root to crest the end had come
she looked to see the thing that had come out of the reeds for a moment it seemed certainly the great head and jaw she expected and then it dwindled and changed it was a dark low thing that remained silent but it was not the lion it became still--everything became still she peered it was like some gigantic frog two limbs and a slanting body its head moved about searching the shadows
a rustle and it moved clumsily with a sort of hopping and as it moved it gave a low groan
the blood rushing through her veins was suddenly joy _ugh-lomi_ she whispered
the thing stopped _eudena_ he answered softly with pain in his voice and peering into the alders
he moved again and came out of the shadow beyond the reeds into the moonlight all his body was covered with dark smears she saw he was dragging his legs and that he gripped his axe the first axe in one hand in another moment he had struggled into the position of all fours and had staggered over to her the lion he said in a strange mingling of exultation and anguish wau--i have slain a lion with my own hand even as i slew the great bear he moved to emphasise his words and suddenly broke off with a faint cry for a space he did not move
let me free whispered eudena he answered her no words but pulled himself up from his crawling attitude by means of the alder stem and hacked at her thongs with the sharp edge of his axe she heard him sob at each blow he cut away the thongs about her chest and arms and then his hand dropped his chest struck against her shoulder and he slipped down beside her and lay still
but the rest of her release was easy very hastily she freed herself she made one step from the tree and her head was spinning her last conscious movement was towards him she reeled and dropped her hand fell upon his thigh it was soft and wet and gave way under her pressure; he cried out at her touch and writhed and lay still again
presently a dark dog-like shape came very softly through the reeds then stopped dead and stood sniffing hesitated and at last turned and slunk back into the shadows
long was the time they remained there motionless with the light of the setting moon shining on their limbs very slowly as slowly as the setting of the moon did the shadow of the reeds towards the mound flow over them presently their legs were hidden and ugh-lomi was but a bust of silver the shadow crept to his neck crept over his face and so at last the darkness of the night swallowed them up
the shadow became full of instinctive stirrings there was a patter of feet and a faint snarling--the sound of a blow
* * * * * there was little sleep that night for the women and children at the squatting-place until they heard eudena scream but the men were weary and sat dozing when eudena screamed they felt assured of their safety and hurried to get the nearest places to the fires the old woman laughed at the scream and laughed again because si the little friend of eudena whimpered directly the dawn came they were all alert and looking towards the alders they could see that eudena had been taken they could not help feeling glad to think that uya was appeased but across the minds of the men the thought of ugh-lomi fell like a shadow they could understand revenge for the world was old in revenge but they did not think of rescue suddenly a hyæna fled out of the thicket and came galloping across the reed space his muzzle and paws were dark-stained at that sight all the men shouted and clutched at throwing-stones and ran towards him for no animal is so pitiful a coward as the hyæna by day all men hated the hyæna because he preyed on children and would come and bite when one was sleeping on the edge of the squatting-place and cats-skin throwing fair and straight hit the brute shrewdly on the flank whereat the whole tribe yelled with delight
at the noise they made there came a flapping of wings from the lair of the lion and three white-headed vultures rose slowly and circled and came to rest amidst the branches of an alder overlooking the lair our lord is abroad said the old woman pointing the vultures have their share of eudena for a space they remained there and then first one and then another dropped back into the thicket
then over the eastern woods and touching the whole world to life and colour poured with the exaltation of a trumpet blast the light of the rising sun at the sight of him the children shouted together and clapped their hands and began to race off towards the water only little si lagged behind and looked wonderingly at the alders where she had seen the head of eudena overnight
but uya the old lion was not abroad but at home and he lay very still and a little on one side he was not in his lair but a little way from it in a place of trampled grass under one eye was a little wound the feeble little bite of the first axe but all the ground beneath his chest was ruddy brown with a vivid streak and in his chest was a little hole that had been made by ugh-lomis stabbing-spear along his side and at his neck the vultures had marked their claims for so ugh-lomi had slain him lying stricken under his paw and thrusting haphazard at his chest he had driven the spear in with all his strength and stabbed the giant to the heart so it was the reign of the lion of the second incarnation of uya the master came to an end
from the knoll the bustle of preparation grew the hacking of spears and throwing-stones none spake the name of ugh-lomi for fear that it might bring him the men were going to keep together close together in the hunting for a day or so and their hunting was to be ugh-lomi lest instead he should come a-hunting them
but ugh-lomi was lying very still and silent outside the lions lair and eudena squatted beside him with the ash spear all smeared with lions blood gripped in her hand
v--the fight in the lions thicket
ugh-lomi lay still his back against an alder and his thigh was a red mass terrible to see no civilised man could have lived who had been so sorely wounded but eudena got him thorns to close his wounds and squatted beside him day and night smiting the flies from him with a fan of reeds by day and in the night threatening the hyænas with the first axe in her hand; and in a little while he began to heal it was high summer and there was no rain little food they had during the first two days his wounds were open in the low place where they hid were no roots nor little beasts and the stream with its water-snails and fish was in the open a hundred yards away she could not go abroad by day for fear of the tribe her brothers and sisters nor by night for fear of the beasts both on his account and hers so they shared the lion with the vultures but there was a trickle of water near by and eudena brought him plenty in her hands
where ugh-lomi lay was well hidden from the tribe by a thicket of alders and all fenced about with bulrushes and tall reeds the dead lion he had killed lay near his old lair on a place of trampled reeds fifty yards away in sight through the reed-stems and the vultures fought each other for the choicest pieces and kept the jackals off him very soon a cloud of flies that looked like bees hung over him and ugh-lomi could hear their humming and when ugh-lomis flesh was already healing--and it was not many days before that began--only a few bones of the lion remained scattered and shining white
for the most part ugh-lomi sat still during the day looking before him at nothing sometimes he would mutter of the horses and bears and lions and sometimes he would beat the ground with the first axe and say the names of the tribe--he seemed to have no fear of bringing the tribe--for hours together but chiefly he slept dreaming little because of his loss of blood and the slightness of his food during the short summer night both kept awake all the while the darkness lasted things moved about them things they never saw by day for some nights the hyænas did not come and then one moonless night near a dozen came and fought for what was left of the lion the night was a tumult of growling and ugh-lomi and eudena could hear the bones snap in their teeth but they knew the hyæna dare not attack any creature alive and awake and so they were not greatly afraid
of a daytime eudena would go along the narrow path the old lion had made in the reeds until she was beyond the bend and then she would creep into the thicket and watch the tribe she would lie close by the alders where they had bound her to offer her up to the lion and thence she could see them on the knoll by the fire small and clear as she had seen them that night but she told ugh-lomi little of what she saw because she feared to bring them by their names for so they believed in those days that naming called
she saw the men prepare stabbing-spears and throwing-stones on the morning after ugh-lomi had slain the lion and go out to hunt him leaving the women and children on the knoll little they knew how near he was as they tracked off in single file towards the hills with siss the tracker leading them and she watched the women and children after the men had gone gathering fern-fronds and twigs for the night fire and the boys and girls running and playing together but the very old woman made her feel afraid towards noon when most of the others were down at the stream by the bend she came and stood on the hither side of the knoll a gnarled brown figure and gesticulated so that eudena could scarce believe she was not seen eudena lay like a hare in its form with shining eyes fixed on the bent witch away there and presently she dimly understood it was the lion the old woman was worshipping--the lion ugh-lomi had slain
and the next day the hunters came back weary carrying a fawn and eudena watched the feast enviously and then came a strange thing she saw--distinctly she heard--the old woman shrieking and gesticulating and pointing towards her she was afraid and crept like a snake out of sight again but presently curiosity overcame her and she was back at her spying-place and as she peered her heart stopped for there were all the men with their weapons in their hands walking together towards her from the knoll
she dared not move lest her movement should be seen but she pressed herself close to the ground the sun was low and the golden light was in the faces of the men she saw they carried a piece of rich red meat thrust through by an ashen stake presently they stopped go on screamed the old woman cats-skin grumbled and they came on searching the thicket with sun-dazzled eyes here said siss and they took the ashen stake with the meat upon it and thrust it into the ground uya cried siss behold thy portion and ugh-lomi we have slain of a truth we have slain ugh-lomi this day we slew ugh-lomi and to-morrow we will bring his body to you and the others repeated the words
they looked at each other and behind them and partly turned and began going back at first they walked half turned to the thicket then facing the mound they walked faster looking over their shoulders then faster; soon they ran it was a race at last until they were near the knoll then siss who was hindmost was first to slacken his pace
the sunset passed and the twilight came the fires glowed red against the hazy blue of the distant chestnut-trees and the voices over the mound were merry eudena lay scarcely stirring looking from the mound to the meat and then to the mound she was hungry but she was afraid at last she crept back to ugh-lomi
he looked round at the little rustle of her approach his face was in shadow have you got me some food? he said
she said she could find nothing but that she would seek further and went back along the lions path until she could see the mound again but she could not bring herself to take the meat; she had the brutes instinct of a snare she felt very miserable
she crept back at last towards ugh-lomi and heard him stirring and moaning she turned back to the mound again; then she saw something in the darkness near the stake and peering distinguished a jackal in a flash she was brave and angry; she sprang up cried out and ran towards the offering she stumbled and fell and heard the growling of the jackal going off
when she arose only the ashen stake lay on the ground the meat was gone so she went back to fast through the night with ugh-lomi; and ugh-lomi was angry with her because she had no food for him; but she told him nothing of the things she had seen
two days passed and they were near starving when the tribe slew a horse then came the same ceremony and a haunch was left on the ashen stake; but this time eudena did not hesitate
by acting and words she made ugh-lomi understand but he ate most of the food before he understood; and then as her meaning passed to him he grew merry with his food i am uya he said; i am the lion i am the great cave bear i who was only ugh-lomi i am wau the cunning it is well that they should feed me for presently i will kill them all
then eudenas heart was light and she laughed with him; and afterwards she ate what he had left of the horseflesh with gladness
after that it was he had a dream and the next day he made eudena bring him the lions teeth and claws--so much of them as she could find--and hack him a club of alder and he put the teeth and claws very cunningly into the wood so that the points were outward very long it took him and he blunted two of the teeth hammering them in and was very angry and threw the thing away; but afterwards he dragged himself to where he had thrown it and finished it--a club of a new sort set with teeth that day there was more meat for them both an offering to the lion from the tribe
it was one day--more than a hands fingers of days more than anyone had skill to count--after ugh-lomi had made the club that eudena while he was asleep was lying in the thicket watching the squatting-place there had been no meat for three days and the old woman came and worshipped after her manner now while she worshipped eudenas little friend si and another the child of the first girl siss had loved came over the knoll and stood regarding her skinny figure and presently they began to mock her eudena found this entertaining but suddenly the old woman turned on them quickly and saw them for a moment she stood and they stood motionless and then with a shriek of rage she rushed towards them and all three disappeared over the crest of the knoll
presently the children reappeared among the ferns beyond the shoulder of the hill little si ran first for she was an active girl and the other child ran squealing with the old woman close upon her and over the knoll came siss with a bone in his hand and bo and cats-skin obsequiously behind him each holding a piece of food and they laughed aloud and shouted to see the old woman so angry and with a shriek the child was caught and the old woman set to work slapping and the child screaming and it was very good after-dinner fun for them little si ran on a little way and stopped at last between fear and curiosity
and suddenly came the mother of the child with hair streaming panting and with a stone in her hand and the old woman turned about like a wild cat she was the equal of any woman was the chief of the fire-minders in spite of her years; but before she could do anything siss shouted to her and the clamour rose loud other shock heads came into sight it seemed the whole tribe was at home and feasting but the old woman dared not go on wreaking herself on the child siss befriended
everyone made noises and called names--even little si abruptly the old woman let go of the child she had caught and made a swift run at si for si had no friends; and si realising her danger when it was almost upon her made off headlong with a faint cry of terror not heeding whither she ran straight to the lair of the lion she swerved aside into the reeds presently realising now whither she went
but the old woman was a wonderful old woman as active as she was spiteful and she caught si by the streaming hair within thirty yards of eudena all the tribe now was running down the knoll and shouting and laughing ready to see the fun
then something stirred in eudena; something that had never stirred in her before; and thinking all of little si and nothing of her fear she sprang up from her ambush and ran swiftly forward the old woman did not see her for she was busy beating little sis face with her hand beating with all her heart and suddenly something hard and heavy struck her cheek she went reeling and saw eudena with flaming eyes and cheeks between her and little si she shrieked with astonishment and terror and little si not understanding set off towards the gaping tribe they were quite close now for the sight of eudena had driven their fading fear of the lion out of their heads
in a moment eudena had turned from the cowering old woman and overtaken si si she cried si she caught the child up in her arms as it stopped pressed the nail-lined face to hers and turned about to run towards her lair the lair of the old lion the old woman stood waist-high in the reeds and screamed foul things and inarticulate rage but did not dare to intercept her; and at the bend of the path eudena looked back and saw all the men of the tribe crying to one another and siss coming at a trot along the lions trail
she ran straight along the narrow way through the reeds to the shady place where ugh-lomi sat with his healing thigh just awakened by the shouting and rubbing his eyes she came to him a woman with little si in her arms her heart throbbed in her throat ugh-lomi she cried ugh-lomi the tribe comes
ugh-lomi sat staring in stupid astonishment at her and si
she pointed with si in one arm she sought among her feeble store of words to explain she could hear the men calling apparently they had stopped outside she put down si and caught up the new club with the lions teeth and put it into ugh-lomis hand and ran three yards and picked up the first axe
ah said ugh-lomi waving the new club and suddenly he perceived the occasion and rolling over began to struggle to his feet
he stood but clumsily he supported himself by one hand against the tree and just touched the ground gingerly with the toe of his wounded leg in the other hand he gripped the new club he looked at his healing thigh; and suddenly the reeds began whispering and ceased and whispered again and coming cautiously along the track bending down and holding his fire-hardened stabbing-stick of ash in his hand appeared siss he stopped dead and his eyes met ugh-lomis
ugh-lomi forgot he had a wounded leg he stood firmly on both feet something trickled he glanced down and saw a little gout of blood had oozed out along the edge of the healing wound he rubbed his hand there to give him the grip of his club and fixed his eyes again on siss
wau he cried and sprang forward and siss still stooping and watchful drove his stabbing-stick up very quickly in an ugly thrust it ripped ugh-lomis guarding arm and the club came down in a counter that siss was never to understand he fell as an ox falls to the pole-axe at ugh-lomis feet
to bo it seemed the strangest thing he had a comforting sense of tall reeds on either side and an impregnable rampart siss between him and any danger snail-eater was close behind and there was no danger there he was prepared to shove behind and send siss to death or victory that was his place as second man he saw the butt of the spear siss carried leap away from him and suddenly a dull whack and the broad back fell away forward and he looked ugh-lomi in the face over his prostrate leader it felt to bo as if his heart had fallen down a well he had a throwing-stone in one hand and an ashen stabbing-stick in the other he did not live to the end of his momentary hesitation which to use
snail-eater was a readier man and besides bo did not fall forward as siss had done but gave at his knees and hips crumpling up with the toothed club upon his head the snail-eater drove his spear forward swift and straight and took ugh-lomi in the muscle of the shoulder and then he drove him hard with the smiting-stone in his other hand shouting out as he did so the new club swished ineffectually through the reeds eudena saw ugh-lomi come staggering back from the narrow path into the open space tripping over siss and with a foot of ashen stake sticking out of him over his arm and then the snail-eater whose name she had given had his final injury from her as his exultant face came out of the reeds after his spear for she swung the first axe swift and high and hit him fair and square on the temple; and down he went on siss at prostrate ugh-lomis feet
but before ugh-lomi could get up the two red-haired men were tumbling out of the reeds spears and smiting-stones ready and snake hard behind them one she struck on the neck but not to fell him and he blundered aside and spoilt his brothers blow at ugh-lomis head in a moment ugh-lomi dropped his club and had his assailant by the waist and had pitched him sideways sprawling he snatched at his club again and recovered it the man eudena had hit stabbed at her with his spear as he stumbled from her blow and involuntarily she gave ground to avoid him he hesitated between her and ugh-lomi half turned gave a vague cry at finding ugh-lomi so near and in a moment ugh-lomi had him by the throat and the club had its third victim as he went down ugh-lomi shouted--no words but an exultant cry
the other red-haired man was six feet from her with his back to her and a darker red streaking his head he was struggling to his feet she had an irrational impulse to stop his rising she flung the axe at him missed saw his face in profile and he had swerved beyond little si and was running through the reeds she had a transitory vision of snake standing in the throat of the path half turned away from her and then she saw his back she saw the club whirling through the air and the shock head of ugh-lomi with blood in the hair and blood upon the shoulder vanishing below the reeds in pursuit then she heard snake scream like a woman
she ran past si to where the handle of the axe stuck out of a clump of fern and turning found herself panting and alone with three motionless bodies the air was full of shouts and screams for a space she was sick and giddy and then it came into her head that ugh-lomi was being killed along the reed-path and with an inarticulate cry she leapt over the body of bo and hurried after him snakes feet lay across the path and his head was among the reeds she followed the path until it bent round and opened out by the alders and thence she saw all that was left of the tribe in the open scattering like dead leaves before a gale and going back over the knoll ugh-lomi was hard upon cats-skin
but cats-skin was fleet of foot and got away and so did young wau-hau when ugh-lomi turned upon him and ugh-lomi pursued wau-hau far beyond the knoll before he desisted he had the rage of battle on him now and the wood thrust through his shoulder stung him like a spur when she saw he was in no danger she stopped running and stood panting watching the distant active figures run up and vanish one by one over the knoll in a little time she was alone again everything had happened very swiftly the smoke of brother fire rose straight and steady from the squatting-place just as it had done ten minutes ago when the old woman had stood yonder worshipping the lion
and after a long time as it seemed ugh-lomi reappeared over the knoll and came back to eudena triumphant and breathing heavily she stood her hair about her eyes and hot-faced with the blood-stained axe in her hand at the place where the tribe had offered her as a sacrifice to the lion wau cried ugh-lomi at the sight of her his face alight with the fellowship of battle and he waved his new club red now and hairy; and at the sight of his glowing face her tense pose relaxed somewhat and she stood sobbing and rejoicing
ugh-lomi had a queer unaccountable pang at the sight of her tears; but he only shouted wau the louder and shook the axe east and west he called manfully to her to follow him and turned back striding with the club swinging in his hand towards the squatting-place as if he had never left the tribe; and she ceased her weeping and followed quickly as a woman should
so ugh-lomi and eudena came back to the squatting-place from which they had fled many days before from the face of uya; and by the squatting-place lay a deer half eaten just as there had been before ugh-lomi was man or eudena woman so ugh-lomi sat down to eat and eudena beside him like a man and the rest of the tribe watched them from safe hiding-places and after a time one of the elder girls came back timorously carrying little si in her arms and eudena called to them by name and offered them food but the elder girl was afraid and would not come though si struggled to come to eudena afterwards when ugh-lomi had eaten he sat dozing and at last he slept and slowly the others came out of the hiding-places and drew near and when ugh-lomi woke save that there were no men to be seen it seemed as though he had never left the tribe
now there is a thing strange but true: that all through this fight ugh-lomi forgot that he was lame and was not lame and after he had rested behold he was a lame man; and he remained a lame man to the end of his days
cats-skin and the second red-haired man and wau-hau who chipped flints cunningly as his father had done before him fled from the face of ugh-lomi and none knew where they hid but two days after they came and squatted a good way off from the knoll among the bracken under the chestnuts and watched ugh-lomis rage had gone he moved to go against them and did not and at sundown they went away that day too they found the old woman among the ferns where ugh-lomi had blundered upon her when he had pursued wau-hau she was dead and more ugly than ever but whole the jackals and vultures had tried her and left her;--she was ever a wonderful old woman
the next day the three men came again and squatted nearer and wau-hau had two rabbits to hold up and the red-haired man a wood-pigeon and ugh-lomi stood before the women and mocked them
the next day they sat again nearer--without stones or sticks and with the same offerings and cats-skin had a trout it was rare men caught fish in those days but cats-skin would stand silently in the water for hours and catch them with his hand and the fourth day ugh-lomi suffered these three to come to the squatting-place in peace with the food they had with them ugh-lomi ate the trout thereafter for many moons ugh-lomi was master and had his will in peace and on the fulness of time he was killed and eaten even as uya had been slain
a story of the days to come
a story of the days to come
i--the cure for love the excellent mr morris was an englishman and he lived in the days of queen victoria the good he was a prosperous and very sensible man; he read the _times_ and went to church and as he grew towards middle age an expression of quiet contented contempt for all who were not as himself settled on his face he was one of those people who do everything that is right and proper and sensible with inevitable regularity he always wore just the right and proper clothes steering the narrow way between the smart and the shabby always subscribed to the right charities just the judicious compromise between ostentation and meanness and never failed to have his hair cut to exactly the proper length
everything that it was right and proper for a man in his position to possess he possessed; and everything that it was not right and proper for a man in his position to possess he did not possess
and among other right and proper possessions this mr morris had a wife and children they were the right sort of wife and the right sort and number of children of course; nothing imaginative or highty-flighty about any of them so far as mr morris could see; they wore perfectly correct clothing neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way but just sensible; and they lived in a nice sensible house in the later victorian sham queen anne style of architecture with sham half-timbering of chocolate-painted plaster in the gables lincrusta walton sham carved oak panels a terrace of terra cotta to imitate stone and cathedral glass in the front door his boys went to good solid schools and were put to respectable professions; his girls in spite of a fantastic protest or so were all married to suitable steady oldish young men with good prospects and when it was a fit and proper thing for him to do so mr morris died his tomb was of marble and without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription quietly imposing--such being the fashion of his time
he underwent various changes according to the accepted custom in these cases and long before this story begins his bones even had become dust and were scattered to the four quarters of heaven and his sons and his grandsons and his great-grandsons and his great-great-grandsons they too were dust and ashes and were scattered likewise it was a thing he could not have imagined that a day would come when even his great-great-grandsons would be scattered to the four winds of heaven if any one had suggested it to him he would have resented it he was one of those worthy people who take no interest in the future of mankind at all he had grave doubts indeed if there was any future for mankind after he was dead
it seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting to imagine anything happening after he was dead yet the thing was so and when even his great-great-grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten when the sham half-timbered house had gone the way of all shams and the _times_ was extinct and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity and the modestly imposing stone that had been sacred to mr morris had been burnt to make lime for mortar and all that mr morris had found real and important was sere and dead the world was still going on and people were still going about it just as heedless and impatient of the future or indeed of anything but their own selves and property as mr morris had been
and strange to tell and much as mr morris would have been angered if any one had foreshadowed it to him all over the world there were scattered a multitude of people filled with the breath of life in whose veins the blood of mr morris flowed just as some day the life which is gathered now in the reader of this very story may also be scattered far and wide about this world and mingled with a thousand alien strains beyond all thought and tracing
and among the descendants of this mr morris was one almost as sensible and clear-headed as his ancestor he had just the same stout short frame as that ancient man of the nineteenth century from whom his name of morris--he spelt it mwres--came; he had the same half-contemptuous expression of face he was a prosperous person too as times went and he disliked the new-fangled and bothers about the future and the lower classes just as much as the ancestral morris had done he did not read the _times_: indeed he did not know there ever had been a _times_--that institution had foundered somewhere in the intervening gulf of years; but the phonograph machine that talked to him as he made his toilet of a morning might have been the voice of a reincarnated blowitz when it dealt with the worlds affairs this phonographic machine was the size and shape of a dutch clock and down the front of it were electric barometric indicators and an electric clock and calendar and automatic engagement reminders and where the clock would have been was the mouth of a trumpet when it had news the trumpet gobbled like a turkey galloop galloop and then brayed out its message as let us say a trumpet might bray it would tell mwres in full rich throaty tones about the overnight accidents to the omnibus flying-machines that plied around the world the latest arrivals at the fashionable resorts in tibet and of all the great monopolist company meetings of the day before while he was dressing if mwres did not like hearing what it said he had only to touch a stud and it would choke a little and talk about something else
of course his toilet differed very much from that of his ancestor it is doubtful which would have been the more shocked and pained to find himself in the clothing of the other mwres would certainly have sooner gone forth to the world stark naked than in the silk hat frock coat grey trousers and watch-chain that had filled mr morris with sombre self-respect in the past for mwres there was no shaving to do: a skilful operator had long ago removed every hair-root from his face his legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments of an air-tight material which with the help of an ingenious little pump he distended so as to suggest enormous muscles above this he also wore pneumatic garments beneath an amber silk tunic so that he was clothed in air and admirably protected against sudden extremes of heat or cold over this he flung a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved on his head which had been skilfully deprived of every scrap of hair he adjusted a pleasant little cap of bright scarlet held on by suction and inflated with hydrogen and curiously like the comb of a cock so his toilet was complete; and conscious of being soberly and becomingly attired he was ready to face his fellow-beings with a tranquil eye
this mwres--the civility of mr had vanished ages ago--was one of the officials under the wind vane and waterfall trust the great company that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the world and which pumped all the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these latter days required he lived in a vast hotel near that part of london called seventh way and had very large and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor households and family life had long since disappeared with the progressive refinement of manners; and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values the disappearance of domestic servants the elaboration of cookery had rendered the separate domicile of victorian times impossible even had any one desired such a savage seclusion when his toilet was completed he went towards one of the two doors of his apartment--there were doors at opposite ends each marked with a huge arrow pointing one one way and one the other--touched a stud to open it and emerged on a wide passage the centre of which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace to the left on some of these chairs were seated gaily-dressed men and women he nodded to an acquaintance--it was not in those days etiquette to talk before breakfast--and seated himself on one of these chairs and in a few seconds he had been carried to the doors of a lift by which he descended to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast would be automatically served
it was a very different meal from a victorian breakfast the rude masses of bread needing to be carved and smeared over with animal fat before they could be made palatable the still recognisable fragments of recently killed animals hideously charred and hacked the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath some protesting hen--such things as these though they constituted the ordinary fare of victorian times would have awakened only horror and disgust in the refined minds of the people of these latter days instead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and variegated design without any suggestion in colour or form of the unfortunate animals from which their substance and juices were derived they appeared on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little box at one side of the table the surface of the table to judge by touch and eye would have appeared to a nineteenth-century person to be covered with fine white damask but this was really an oxidised metallic surface and could be cleaned instantly after a meal there were hundreds of such little tables in the hall and at most of them were other latter-day citizens singly or in groups and as mwres seated himself before his elegant repast the invisible orchestra which had been resting during an interval resumed and filled the air with music
but mwres did not display any great interest either in his breakfast or the music; his eye wandered incessantly about the hall as though he expected a belated guest at last he rose eagerly and waved his hand and simultaneously across the hall appeared a tall dark figure in a costume of yellow and olive green as this person walking amidst the tables with measured steps drew near the pallid earnestness of his face and the unusual intensity of his eyes became apparent mwres reseated himself and pointed to a chair beside him
i feared you would never come he said in spite of the intervening space of time the english language was still almost exactly the same as it had been in england under victoria the good the invention of the phonograph and suchlike means of recording sound and the gradual replacement of books by such contrivances had not only saved the human eyesight from decay but had also by the establishment of a sure standard arrested the process of change in accent that had hitherto been so inevitable
i was delayed by an interesting case said the man in green and yellow a prominent politician--ahem--suffering from overwork he glanced at the breakfast and seated himself i have been awake for forty hours
eh dear said mwres: fancy that you hypnotists have your work to do
the hypnotist helped himself to some attractive amber-coloured jelly i happen to be a good deal in request he said modestly
heaven knows what we should do without you
oh were not so indispensable as all that said the hypnotist ruminating the flavour of the jelly the world did very well without us for some thousands of years two hundred years ago even--not one in practice that is physicians by the thousand of course--frightfully clumsy brutes for the most part and following one another like sheep--but doctors of the mind except a few empirical flounderers there were none
he concentrated his mind on the jelly
but were people so sane--? began mwres
the hypnotist shook his head it didnt matter then if they were a bit silly or faddy life was so easy-going then no competition worth speaking of--no pressure a human being had to be very lopsided before anything happened then you know they clapped em away in what they called a lunatic asylum
i know said mwres in these confounded historical romances that every one is listening to they always rescue a beautiful girl from an asylum or something of the sort i dont know if you attend to that rubbish
i must confess i do said the hypnotist it carries one out of oneself to hear of those quaint adventurous half-civilised days of the nineteenth century when men were stout and women simple i like a good swaggering story before all things curious times they were with their smutty railways and puffing old iron trains their rum little houses and their horse vehicles i suppose you dont read books?
dear no said mwres i went to a modern school and we had none of that old-fashioned nonsense phonographs are good enough for me
of course said the hypnotist of course; and surveyed the table for his next choice you know he said helping himself to a dark blue confection that promised well in those days our business was scarcely thought of i daresay if any one had told them that in two hundred years time a class of men would be entirely occupied in impressing things upon the memory effacing unpleasant ideas controlling and overcoming instinctive but undesirable impulses and so forth by means of hypnotism they would have refused to believe the thing possible few people knew that an order made during a mesmeric trance even an order to forget or an order to desire could be given so as to be obeyed after the trance was over yet there were men alive then who could have told them the thing was as absolutely certain to come about as--well the transit of venus
they knew of hypnotism then? oh dear yes they used it--for painless dentistry and things like that this blue stuff is confoundedly good: what is it?
havent the faintest idea said mwres but i admit its very good take some more
the hypnotist repeated his praises and there was an appreciative pause
speaking of these historical romances said mwres with an attempt at an easy off-hand manner brings me--ah--to the matter i--ah--had in mind when i asked you--when i expressed a wish to see you he paused and took a deep breath
the hypnotist turned an attentive eye upon him and continued eating
the fact is said mwres i have a--in fact a--daughter well you know i have given her--ah--every educational advantage lectures--not a solitary lecturer of ability in the world but she has had a telephone direct dancing deportment conversation philosophy art criticism  he indicated catholic culture by a gesture of his hand i had intended her to marry a very good friend of mine--bindon of the lighting commission--plain little man you know and a bit unpleasant in some of his ways but an excellent fellow really--an excellent fellow
yes said the hypnotist go on how old is she?
eighteen a dangerous age well? well: it seems that she has been indulging in these historical romances--excessively excessively even to the neglect of her philosophy filled her mind with unutterable nonsense about soldiers who fight--what is it?--etruscans?
egyptians egyptians--very probably hack about with swords and revolvers and things--bloodshed galore--horrible--and about young men on torpedo catchers who blow up--spaniards i fancy--and all sorts of irregular adventurers and she has got it into her head that she must marry for love and that poor little bindon--
ive met similar cases said the hypnotist who is the other young man?
mwres maintained an appearance of resigned calm you may well ask he said he is--and his voice sank with shame--a mere attendant upon the stage on which the flying-machines from paris alight he has--as they say in the romances--good looks he is quite young and very eccentric affects the antique--he can read and write so can she and instead of communicating by telephone like sensible people they write and deliver--what is it?
notes? no--not notes ah--poems the hypnotist raised his eyebrows how did she meet him?
tripped coming down from the flying-machine from paris--and fell into his arms the mischief was done in a moment
yes? well--thats all things must be stopped that is what i want to consult you about what must be done? what _can_ be done? of course im not a hypnotist; my knowledge is limited but you--?
hypnotism is not magic said the man in green putting both arms on the table
oh precisely but still-- people cannot be hypnotised without their consent if she is able to stand out against marrying bindon she will probably stand out against being hypnotised but if once she can be hypnotised--even by somebody else--the thing is done
you can--? oh certainly once we get her amenable then we can suggest that she _must_ marry bindon--that that is her fate; or that the young man is repulsive and that when she sees him she will be giddy and faint or any little thing of that sort or if we can get her into a sufficiently profound trance we can suggest that she should forget him altogether--
precisely but the problem is to get her hypnotised of course no sort of proposal or suggestion must come from you--because no doubt she already distrusts you in the matter
the hypnotist leant his head upon his arm and thought
its hard a man cannot dispose of his own daughter said mwres irrelevantly
you must give me the name and address of the young lady said the hypnotist and any information bearing upon the matter and by the bye is there any money in the affair?
mwres hesitated theres a sum--in fact a considerable sum--invested in the patent road company from her mother thats what makes the thing so exasperating
exactly said the hypnotist and he proceeded to cross-examine mwres on the entire affair
it was a lengthy interview and meanwhile elizebeθ mwres as she spelt her name or elizabeth morris as a nineteenth-century person would have put it was sitting in a quiet waiting-place beneath the great stage upon which the flying-machine from paris descended and beside her sat her slender handsome lover reading her the poem he had written that morning while on duty upon the stage when he had finished they sat for a time in silence; and then as if for their special entertainment the great machine that had come flying through the air from america that morning rushed down out of the sky
at first it was a little oblong faint and blue amidst the distant fleecy clouds; and then it grew swiftly large and white and larger and whiter until they could see the separate tiers of sails each hundreds of feet wide and the lank body they supported and at last even the swinging seats of the passengers in a dotted row although it was falling it seemed to them to be rushing up the sky and over the roof-spaces of the city below its shadow leapt towards them they heard the whistling rush of the air about it and its yelling siren shrill and swelling to warn those who were on its landing-stage of its arrival and abruptly the note fell down a couple of octaves and it had passed and the sky was clear and void and she could turn her sweet eyes again to denton at her side
their silence ended; and denton speaking in a little language of broken english that was they fancied their private possession--though lovers have used such little languages since the world began--told her how they too would leap into the air one morning out of all the obstacles and difficulties about them and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of in japan half-way about the world
she loved the dream but she feared the leap; and she put him off with some day dearest one some day to all his pleading that it might be soon; and at last came a shrilling of whistles and it was time for him to go back to his duties on the stage they parted--as lovers have been wont to part for thousands of years she walked down a passage to a lift and so came to one of the streets of that latter-day london all glazed in with glass from the weather and with incessant moving platforms that went to all parts of the city and by one of these she returned to her apartments in the hotel for women where she lived the apartments that were in telephonic communication with all the best lecturers in the world but the sunlight of the flying stage was in her heart and the wisdom of all the best lecturers in the world seemed folly in that light
she spent the middle part of the day in the gymnasium and took her midday meal with two other girls and their common chaperone--for it was still the custom to have a chaperone in the case of motherless girls of the more prosperous classes the chaperone had a visitor that day a man in green and yellow with a white face and vivid eyes who talked amazingly among other things he fell to praising a new historical romance that one of the great popular story-tellers of the day had just put forth it was of course about the spacious times of queen victoria; and the author among other pleasing novelties made a little argument before each section of the story in imitation of the chapter headings of the old-fashioned books: as for example how the cabmen of pimlico stopped the victoria omnibuses and of the great fight in palace yard and how the piccadilly policeman was slain in the midst of his duty the man in green and yellow praised this innovation these pithy sentences he said are admirable they show at a glance those headlong tumultuous times when men and animals jostled in the filthy streets and death might wait for one at every corner life was life then how great the world must have seemed then how marvellous they were still parts of the world absolutely unexplored nowadays we have almost abolished wonder we lead lives so trim and orderly that courage endurance faith all the noble virtues seem fading from mankind
and so on taking the girls thoughts with him until the life they led life in the vast and intricate london of the twenty-second century a life interspersed with soaring excursions to every part of the globe seemed to them a monotonous misery compared with the dædal past
at first elizabeth did not join in the conversation but after a time the subject became so interesting that she made a few shy interpolations but he scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked he went on to describe a new method of entertaining people they were hypnotised and then suggestions were made to them so skilfully that they seemed to be living in ancient times again they played out a little romance in the past as vivid as reality and when at last they awakened they remembered all they had been through as though it were a real thing
it is a thing we have sought to do for years and years said the hypnotist it is practically an artificial dream and we know the way at last think of all it opens out to us--the enrichment of our experience the recovery of adventure the refuge it offers from this sordid competitive life in which we live think
and you can do that said the chaperone eagerly
the thing is possible at last the hypnotist said you may order a dream as you wish
the chaperone was the first to be hypnotised and the dream she said was wonderful when she came to again
the other two girls encouraged by her enthusiasm also placed themselves in the hands of the hypnotist and had plunges into the romantic past no one suggested that elizabeth should try this novel entertainment; it was at her own request at last that she was taken into that land of dreams where there is neither any freedom of choice nor will
and so the mischief was done
one day when denton went down to that quiet seat beneath the flying stage elizabeth was not in her wonted place he was disappointed and a little angry the next day she did not come and the next also he was afraid to hide his fear from himself he set to work to write sonnets for her when she should come again
for three days he fought against his dread by such distraction and then the truth was before him clear and cold and would not be denied she might be ill she might be dead; but he would not believe that he had been betrayed there followed a week of misery and then he knew she was the only thing on earth worth having and that he must seek her however hopeless the search until she was found once more
he had some small private means of his own and so he threw over his appointment on the flying stage and set himself to find this girl who had become at last all the world to him he did not know where she lived and little of her circumstances; for it had been part of the delight of her girlish romance that he should know nothing of her nothing of the difference of their station the ways of the city opened before him east and west north and south even in victorian days london was a maze that little london with its poor four millions of people; but the london he explored the london of the twenty-second century was a london of thirty million souls at first he was energetic and headlong taking time neither to eat nor sleep he sought for weeks and months he went through every imaginable phase of fatigue and despair over-excitement and anger long after hope was dead by the sheer inertia of his desire he still went to and fro peering into faces and looking this way and that in the incessant ways and lifts and passages of that interminable hive of men
at last chance was kind to him and he saw her
it was in a time of festivity he was hungry; he had paid the inclusive fee and had gone into one of the gigantic dining-places of the city; he was pushing his way among the tables and scrutinising by mere force of habit every group he passed
he stood still robbed of all power of motion his eyes wide his lips apart elizabeth sat scarcely twenty yards away from him looking straight at him her eyes were as hard to him as hard and expressionless and void of recognition as the eyes of a statue
she looked at him for a moment and then her gaze passed beyond him
had he had only her eyes to judge by he might have doubted if it was indeed elizabeth but he knew her by the gesture of her hand by the grace of a wanton little curl that floated over her ear as she moved her head something was said to her and she turned smiling tolerantly to the man beside her a little man in foolish raiment knobbed and spiked like some odd reptile with pneumatic horns--the bindon of her fathers choice
for a moment denton stood white and wild-eyed; then came a terrible faintness and he sat before one of the little tables he sat down with his back to her and for a time he did not dare to look at her again when at last he did she and bindon and two other people were standing up to go the others were her father and her chaperone
he sat as if incapable of action until the four figures were remote and small and then he rose up possessed with the one idea of pursuit for a space he feared he had lost them and then he came upon elizabeth and her chaperone again in one of the streets of moving platforms that intersected the city bindon and mwres had disappeared
he could not control himself to patience he felt he must speak to her forthwith or die he pushed forward to where they were seated and sat down beside them his white face was convulsed with half-hysterical excitement
he laid his hand on her wrist elizabeth? he said
she turned in unfeigned astonishment nothing but the fear of a strange man showed in her face
elizabeth he cried and his voice was strange to him: dearest--you _know_ me?
elizabeths face showed nothing but alarm and perplexity she drew herself away from him the chaperone a little grey-headed woman with mobile features leant forward to intervene her resolute bright eyes examined denton _what_ do you say? she asked
this young lady said denton--she knows me
do you know him dear? no said elizabeth in a strange voice and with a hand to her forehead speaking almost as one who repeats a lesson no i do not know him i _know_--i do not know him
but--but  not know me it is i--denton denton to whom you used to talk dont you remember the flying stages? the little seat in the open air? the verses--
no cried elizabeth--no i do not know him i do not know him there is something but i dont know all i know is that i do not know him her face was a face of infinite distress
the sharp eyes of the chaperone flitted to and fro from the girl to the man you see? she said with the faint shadow of a smile she does not know you
i do not know you said elizabeth of that i am sure
but dear--the songs--the little verses-- she does not know you said the chaperone you must not you have made a mistake you must not go on talking to us after that you must not annoy us on the public ways
but-- said denton and for a moment his miserably haggard face appealed against fate
you must not persist young man protested the chaperone
_elizabeth_ he cried her face was the face of one who is tormented i do not know you she cried hand to brow oh i do not know you
for an instant denton sat stunned then he stood up and groaned aloud
he made a strange gesture of appeal towards the remote glass roof of the public way then turned and went plunging recklessly from one moving platform to another and vanished amidst the swarms of people going to and fro thereon the chaperones eyes followed him and then she looked at the curious faces about her
dear asked elizabeth clasping her hand and too deeply moved to heed observation who was that man? who _was_ that man?
the chaperone raised her eyebrows she spoke in a clear audible voice some half-witted creature i have never set eyes on him before
never? never dear do not trouble your mind about a thing like this
* * * * * and soon after this the celebrated hypnotist who dressed in green and yellow had another client the young man paced his consulting-room pale and disordered i want to forget he cried i _must_ forget
the hypnotist watched him with quiet eyes studied his face and clothes and bearing to forget anything--pleasure or pain--is to be by so much--_less_ however you know your own concern my fee is high
if only i can forget-- thats easy enough with you you wish it ive done much harder things quite recently i hardly expected to do it: the thing was done against the will of the hypnotised person a love affair too--like yours a girl so rest assured
the young man came and sat beside the hypnotist his manner was a forced calm he looked into the hypnotists eyes i will tell you of course you will want to know what it is there was a girl her name was elizabeth mwres well 
he stopped he had seen the instant surprise on the hypnotists face in that instant he knew he stood up he seemed to dominate the seated figure by his side he gripped the shoulder of green and gold for a time he could not find words
_give her me back_ he said at last give her me back
what do you mean? gasped the hypnotist
give her me back give whom?
elizabeth mwres--the girl-- the hypnotist tried to free himself; he rose to his feet dentons grip tightened
let go cried the hypnotist thrusting an arm against dentons chest
in a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy wrestle neither had the slightest training--for athleticism except for exhibition and to afford opportunity for betting had faded out of the earth--but denton was not only the younger but the stronger of the two they swayed across the room and then the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist they fell together
denton leaped to his feet dismayed at his own fury; but the hypnotist lay still and suddenly from a little white mark where his forehead had struck a stool shot a hurrying band of red for a space denton stood over him irresolute trembling
a fear of the consequences entered his gently nurtured mind he turned towards the door no he said aloud and came back to the middle of the room overcoming the instinctive repugnance of one who had seen no act of violence in all his life before he knelt down beside his antagonist and felt his heart then he peered at the wound he rose quietly and looked about him he began to see more of the situation
when presently the hypnotist recovered his senses his head ached severely his back was against dentons knees and denton was sponging his face
the hypnotist did not speak but presently he indicated by a gesture that in his opinion he had been sponged enough let me get up he said
not yet said denton you have assaulted me you scoundrel
we are alone said denton and the door is secure
there was an interval of thought
unless i sponge said denton your forehead will develop a tremendous bruise
you can go on sponging said the hypnotist sulkily
there was another pause we might be in the stone age said the hypnotist violence struggle
in the stone age no man dared to come between man and woman said denton
the hypnotist thought again what are you going to do? he asked
while you were insensible i found the girls address on your tablets i did not know it before i telephoned she will be here soon then--
she will bring her chaperone that is all right
but what--? i dont see what do you mean to do?
i looked about for a weapon also it is an astonishing thing how few weapons there are nowadays if you consider that in the stone age men owned scarcely anything _but_ weapons i hit at last upon this lamp i have wrenched off the wires and things and i hold it so he extended it over the hypnotists shoulders with that i can quite easily smash your skull i _will_--unless you do as i tell you
violence is no remedy said the hypnotist quoting from the modern mans book of moral maxims
its an undesirable disease said denton
well? you will tell that chaperone you are going to order the girl to marry that knobby little brute with the red hair and ferrety eyes i believe thats how things stand?
yes--thats how things stand and pretending to do that you will restore her memory of me
its unprofessional look here if i cannot have that girl i would rather die than not i dont propose to respect your little fancies if anything goes wrong you shall not live five minutes this is a rude makeshift of a weapon and it may quite conceivably be painful to kill you but i will it is unusual i know nowadays to do things like this--mainly because there is so little in life that is worth being violent about
the chaperone will see you directly she comes--
i shall stand in that recess behind you
the hypnotist thought you are a determined young man he said and only half civilised i have tried to do my duty to my client but in this affair you seem likely to get your own way
you mean to deal straightly im not going to risk having my brains scattered in a petty affair like this
and afterwards? there is nothing a hypnotist or doctor hates so much as a scandal i at least am no savage i am annoyed but in a day or so i shall bear no malice
thank you and now that we understand each other there is no necessity to keep you sitting any longer on the floor
ii--the vacant country the world they say changed more between the year 1800 and the year 1900 than it had done in the previous five hundred years that century the nineteenth century was the dawn of a new epoch in the history of mankind--the epoch of the great cities the end of the old order of country life
in the beginning of the nineteenth century the majority of mankind still lived upon the countryside as their way of life had been for countless generations all over the world they dwelt in little towns and villages then and engaged either directly in agriculture or in occupations that were of service to the agriculturist they travelled rarely and dwelt close to their work because swift means of transit had not yet come the few who travelled went either on foot or in slow sailing-ships or by means of jogging horses incapable of more than sixty miles a day think of it--sixty miles a day here and there in those sluggish times a town grew a little larger than its neighbours as a port or as a centre of government; but all the towns in the world with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants could be counted on a mans fingers so it was in the beginning of the nineteenth century by the end the invention of railways telegraphs steamships and complex agricultural machinery had changed all these things: changed them beyond all hope of return the vast shops the varied pleasures the countless conveniences of the larger towns were suddenly possible and no sooner existed than they were brought into competition with the homely resources of the rural centres mankind were drawn to the cities by an overwhelming attraction the demand for labour fell with the increase of machinery the local markets were entirely superseded and there was a rapid growth of the larger centres at the expense of the open country
the flow of population townward was the constant preoccupation of victorian writers in great britain and new england in india and china the same thing was remarked: everywhere a few swollen towns were visibly replacing the ancient order that this was an inevitable result of improved means of travel and transport--that given swift means of transit these things must be--was realised by few; and the most puerile schemes were devised to overcome the mysterious magnetism of the urban centres and keep the people on the land
yet the developments of the nineteenth century were only the dawning of the new order the first great cities of the new time were horribly inconvenient darkened by smoky fogs insanitary and noisy; but the discovery of new methods of building new methods of heating changed all this between 1900 and 2000 the march of change was still more rapid; and between 2000 and 2100 the continually accelerated progress of human invention made the reign of victoria the good seem at last an almost incredible vision of idyllic tranquil days
the introduction of railways was only the first step in that development of those means of locomotion which finally revolutionised human life by the year 2000 railways and roads had vanished together the railways robbed of their rails had become weedy ridges and ditches upon the face of the world; the old roads strange barbaric tracks of flint and soil hammered by hand or rolled by rough iron rollers strewn with miscellaneous filth and cut by iron hoofs and wheels into ruts and puddles often many inches deep had been replaced by patent tracks made of a substance called eadhamite this eadhamite--it was named after its patentee--ranks with the invention of printing and steam as one of the epoch-making discoveries of the worlds history
when eadham discovered the substance he probably thought of it as a mere cheap substitute for india rubber; it cost a few shillings a ton but you can never tell all an invention will do it was the genius of a man named warming that pointed to the possibility of using it not only for the tires of wheels but as a road substance and who organised the enormous network of public ways that speedily covered the world
these public ways were made with longitudinal divisions on the outer on either side went foot cyclists and conveyances travelling at a less speed than twenty-five miles an hour; in the middle motors capable of speed up to a hundred; and the inner warming (in the face of enormous ridicule) reserved for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred miles an hour and upward
for ten years his inner ways were vacant before he died they were the most crowded of all and vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and thirty feet in diameter hurled along them at paces that year after year rose steadily towards two hundred miles an hour and by the time this revolution was accomplished a parallel revolution had transformed the ever-growing cities before the development of practical science the fogs and filth of victorian times vanished electric heating replaced fires (in 2013 the lighting of a fire that did not absolutely consume its own smoke was made an indictable nuisance) and all the city ways all public squares and places were covered in with a recently invented glass-like substance the roofing of london became practically continuous certain short-sighted and foolish legislation against tall buildings was abolished and london from a squat expanse of petty houses--feebly archaic in design--rose steadily towards the sky to the municipal responsibility for water light and drainage was added another and that was ventilation
but to tell of all the changes in human convenience that these two hundred years brought about to tell of the long foreseen invention of flying to describe how life in households was steadily supplanted by life in interminable hotels how at last even those who were still concerned in agricultural work came to live in the towns and to go to and fro to their work every day to describe how at last in all england only four towns remained each with many millions of people and how there were left no inhabited houses in all the countryside: to tell all this would take us far from our story of denton and his elizabeth they had been separated and reunited and still they could not marry for denton--it was his only fault--had no money neither had elizabeth until she was twenty-one and as yet she was only eighteen at twenty-one all the property of her mother would come to her for that was the custom of the time she did not know that it was possible to anticipate her fortune and denton was far too delicate a lover to suggest such a thing so things stuck hopelessly between them elizabeth said that she was very unhappy and that nobody understood her but denton and that when she was away from him she was wretched; and denton said that his heart longed for her day and night and they met as often as they could to enjoy the discussion of their sorrows
they met one day at their little seat upon the flying stage the precise site of this meeting was where in victorian times the road from wimbledon came out upon the common they were however five hundred feet above that point their seat looked far over london to convey the appearance of it all to a nineteenth-century reader would have been difficult one would have had to tell him to think of the crystal palace of the newly built mammoth hotels--as those little affairs were called--of the larger railway stations of his time and to imagine such buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run together and continuous over the whole metropolitan area if then he was told that this continuous roof-space bore a huge forest of rotating wind-wheels he would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to these young people was the commonest sight in their lives
to their eyes it had something of the quality of a prison and they were talking as they had talked a hundred times before of how they might escape from it and be at last happy together: escape from it that is before the appointed three years were at an end it was they both agreed not only impossible but almost wicked to wait three years before that said denton--and the notes of his voice told of a splendid chest--_we might both be dead_
their vigorous young hands had to grip at this and then elizabeth had a still more poignant thought that brought the tears from her wholesome eyes and down her healthy cheeks _one_ of us she said _one_ of us might be--
she choked; she could not say the word that is so terrible to the young and happy
yet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that time was--for any one who had lived pleasantly--a very dreadful thing in the old agricultural days that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century there had been a pretty proverb of love in a cottage; and indeed in those days the poor of the countryside had dwelt in flower-covered diamond-windowed cottages of thatch and plaster with the sweet air and earth about them amidst tangled hedges and the song of birds and with the ever-changing sky overhead but all this had changed (the change was already beginning in the nineteenth century) and a new sort of life was opening for the poor--in the lower quarters of the city
in the nineteenth century the lower quarters were still beneath the sky; they were areas of land on clay or other unsuitable soil liable to floods or exposed to the smoke of more fortunate districts insufficiently supplied with water and as insanitary as the great fear of infectious diseases felt by the wealthier classes permitted in the twenty-second century however the growth of the city storey above storey and the coalescence of buildings had led to a different arrangement the prosperous people lived in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper storeys and halls of the city fabric; the industrial population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-floor and basement so to speak of the place
in the refinement of life and manners these lower classes differed little from their ancestors the east-enders of queen victorias time; but they had developed a distinct dialect of their own in these under ways they lived and died rarely ascending to the surface except when work took them there since for most of them this was the sort of life to which they had been born they found no great misery in such circumstances; but for people like denton and elizabeth such a plunge would have seemed more terrible than death
and yet what else is there? asked elizabeth
denton professed not to know apart from his own feeling of delicacy he was not sure how elizabeth would like the idea of borrowing on the strength of her expectations
the passage from london to paris even said elizabeth was beyond their means; and in paris as in any other city in the world life would be just as costly and impossible as in london
well might denton cry aloud: if only we had lived in those days dearest if only we had lived in the past for to their eyes even nineteenth-century whitechapel was seen through a mist of romance
is there _nothing_? cried elizabeth suddenly weeping must we really wait for those three long years? fancy _three_ years--six-and-thirty months the human capacity for patience had not grown with the ages
then suddenly denton was moved to speak of something that had already flickered across his mind he had hit upon it at last it seemed to him so wild a suggestion that he made it only half seriously but to put a thing into words has ever a way of making it seem more real and possible than it seemed before and so it was with him
suppose he said we went into the country?
she looked at him to see if he was serious in proposing such an adventure
the country? yes--beyond there beyond the hills
how could we live? she said _where_ could we live?
it is not impossible he said people used to live in the country
but then there were houses there are the ruins of villages and towns now on the clay lands they are gone of course but they are still left on the grazing land because it does not pay the food company to remove them i know that--for certain besides one sees them from the flying machines you know well we might shelter in some one of these and repair it with our hands do you know the thing is not so wild as it seems some of the men who go out every day to look after the crops and herds might be paid to bring us food
she stood in front of him how strange it would be if one really could
why not? but no one dares
that is no reason it would be--oh it would be so romantic and strange if only it were possible
why not possible? there are so many things think of all the things we have things that we should miss
should we miss them? after all the life we lead is very unreal--very artificial he began to expand his idea and as he warmed to his exposition the fantastic quality of his first proposal faded away
she thought but i have heard of prowlers--escaped criminals
he nodded he hesitated over his answer because he thought it sounded boyish he blushed i could get some one i know to make me a sword
she looked at him with enthusiasm growing in her eyes she had heard of swords had seen one in a museum; she thought of those ancient days when men wore them as a common thing his suggestion seemed an impossible dream to her and perhaps for that reason she was eager for more detail and inventing for the most part as he went along he told her how they might live in the country as the old-world people had done with every detail her interest grew for she was one of those girls for whom romance and adventure have a fascination
his suggestion seemed i say an impossible dream to her on that day but the next day they talked about it again and it was strangely less impossible
at first we should take food said denton we could carry food for ten or twelve days it was an age of compact artificial nourishment and such a provision had none of the unwieldy suggestion it would have had in the nineteenth century
but--until our house she asked--until it was ready where should we sleep?
it is summer but  what do you mean?
there was a time when there were no houses in the world; when all mankind slept always in the open air
but for us the emptiness no walls--no ceiling
dear he said in london you have many beautiful ceilings artists paint them and stud them with lights but i have seen a ceiling more beautiful than any in london
but where? it is the ceiling under which we two would be alone
you mean? dear he said it is something the world has forgotten it is heaven and all the host of stars
each time they talked the thing seemed more possible and more desirable to them in a week or so it was quite possible another week and it was the inevitable thing they had to do a great enthusiasm for the country seized hold of them and possessed them the sordid tumult of the town they said overwhelmed them they marvelled that this simple way out of their troubles had never come upon them before
one morning near midsummer-day there was a new minor official upon the flying stage and dentons place was to know him no more
our two young people had secretly married and were going forth manfully out of the city in which they and their ancestors before them had lived all their days she wore a new dress of white cut in an old-fashioned pattern and he had a bundle of provisions strapped athwart his back and in his hand he carried--rather shame-facedly it is true and under his purple cloak--an implement of archaic form a cross-hilted thing of tempered steel
imagine that going forth in their days the sprawling suburbs of victorian times with their vile roads petty houses foolish little gardens of shrub and geranium and all their futile pretentious privacies had disappeared: the towering buildings of the new age the mechanical ways the electric and water mains all came to an end together like a wall like a cliff near four hundred feet in height abrupt and sheer all about the city spread the carrot swede and turnip fields of the food company vegetables that were the basis of a thousand varied foods and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly extirpated the incessant expense of weeding that went on year after year in the petty wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days the food company had economised for ever more by a campaign of extermination here and there however neat rows of bramble standards and apple trees with whitewashed stems intersected the fields and at places groups of gigantic teazles reared their favoured spikes here and there huge agricultural machines hunched under waterproof covers the mingled waters of the wey and mole and wandle ran in rectangular channels; and wherever a gentle elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of deodorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the land and made a rainbow of the sunlight
by a great archway in that enormous city wall emerged the eadhamite road to portsmouth swarming in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic bearing the blue-clad servants of the food company to their toil a rushing traffic beside which they seemed two scarce-moving dots along the outer tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little old-fashioned motors of such as had duties within twenty miles or so of the city; the inner ways were filled with vaster mechanisms--swift monocycles bearing a score of men lank multicycles quadricycles sagging with heavy loads empty gigantic produce carts that would come back again filled before the sun was setting all with throbbing engines and noiseless wheels and a perpetual wild melody of horns and gongs
along the very verge of the outermost way our young people went in silence newly wed and oddly shy of one anothers company many were the things shouted to them as they tramped along for in 2100 a foot-passenger on an english road was almost as strange a sight as a motor car would have been in 1800 but they went on with steadfast eyes into the country paying no heed to such cries
before them in the south rose the downs blue at first and as they came nearer changing to green surmounted by the row of gigantic wind-wheels that supplemented the wind-wheels upon the roof-spaces of the city and broken and restless with the long morning shadows of those whirling vanes by midday they had come so near that they could see here and there little patches of pallid dots--the sheep the meat department of the food company owned in another hour they had passed the clay and the root crops and the single fence that hedged them in and the prohibition against trespass no longer held: the levelled roadway plunged into a cutting with all its traffic and they could leave it and walk over the greensward and up the open hillside
never had these children of the latter days been together in such a lonely place
they were both very hungry and footsore--for walking was a rare exercise--and presently they sat down on the weedless close-cropped grass and looked back for the first time at the city from which they had come shining wide and splendid in the blue haze of the valley of the thames elizabeth was a little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the slope--she had never been near big unrestrained animals before--but denton reassured her and overhead a white-winged bird circled in the blue
they talked but little until they had eaten and then their tongues were loosened he spoke of the happiness that was now certainly theirs of the folly of not breaking sooner out of that magnificent prison of latter-day life of the old romantic days that had passed from the world for ever and then he became boastful he took up the sword that lay on the ground beside him and she took it from his hand and ran a tremulous finger along the blade
and you could she said _you_--could raise this and strike a man?
why not? if there were need
but she said it seems so horrible it would slash there would be--her voice sank--_blood_
in the old romances you have read often enough 
oh i know: in those--yes but that is different one knows it is not blood but just a sort of red ink and _you_--killing
she looked at him doubtfully and then handed him back the sword
after they had rested and eaten they rose up and went on their way towards the hills they passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep who stared and bleated at their unaccustomed figures she had never seen sheep before and she shivered to think such gentle things must needs be slain for food a sheep-dog barked from a distance and then a shepherd appeared amidst the supports of the wind-wheels and came down towards them
when he drew near he called out asking whither they were going
denton hesitated and told him briefly that they sought some ruined house among the downs in which they might live together he tried to speak in an off-hand manner as though it was a usual thing to do the man stared incredulously
have you _done_ anything? he asked
nothing said denton only we dont want to live in a city any longer why should we live in cities?
the shepherd stared more incredulously than ever you cant live here he said
we mean to try the shepherd stared from one to the other youll go back to-morrow he said it looks pleasant enough in the sunlight are you sure youve done nothing? we shepherds are not such _great_ friends of the police
denton looked at him steadfastly no he said but we are too poor to live in the city and we cant bear the thought of wearing clothes of blue canvas and doing drudgery we are going to live a simple life here like the people of old
the shepherd was a bearded man with a thoughtful face he glanced at elizabeths fragile beauty
_they_ had simple minds he said
so have we said denton the shepherd smiled
if you go along here he said along the crest beneath the wind-wheels you will see a heap of mounds and ruins on your right-hand side that was once a town called epsom there are no houses there and the bricks have been used for a sheep pen go on and another heap on the edge of the root-land is leatherhead; and then the hill turns away along the border of a valley and there are woods of beech keep along the crest you will come to quite wild places in some parts in spite of all the weeding that is done ferns and bluebells and other such useless plants are growing still and through it all underneath the wind-wheels runs a straight lane paved with stones a roadway of the romans two thousand years old go to the right of that down into the valley and follow it along by the banks of the river you come presently to a street of houses many with the roofs still sound upon them there you may find shelter
they thanked him but its a quiet place there is no light after dark there and i have heard tell of robbers it is lonely nothing happens there the phonographs of the story-tellers the kinematograph entertainments the news machines--none of them are to be found there if you are hungry there is no food if you are ill no doctor  he stopped
we shall try it said denton moving to go on then a thought struck him and he made an agreement with the shepherd and learnt where they might find him to buy and bring them anything of which they stood in need out of the city
and in the evening they came to the deserted village with its houses that seemed so small and odd to them: they found it golden in the glory of the sunset and desolate and still they went from one deserted house to another marvelling at their quaint simplicity and debating which they should choose and at last in a sunlit corner of a room that had lost its outer wall they came upon a wild flower a little flower of blue that the weeders of the food company had overlooked
that house they decided upon; but they did not remain in it long that night because they were resolved to feast upon nature and moreover the houses became very gaunt and shadowy after the sunlight had faded out of the sky so after they had rested a little time they went to the crest of the hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of heaven set with stars about which the old poets had had so many things to tell it was a wonderful sight and denton talked like the stars and when they went down the hill at last the sky was pale with dawn they slept but little and in the morning when they woke a thrush was singing in a tree
so these young people of the twenty-second century began their exile that morning they were very busy exploring the resources of this new home in which they were going to live the simple life they did not explore very fast or very far because they went everywhere hand-in-hand; but they found the beginnings of some furniture beyond the village was a store of winter fodder for the sheep of the food company and denton dragged great armfuls to the house to make a bed; and in several of the houses were old fungus-eaten chairs and tables--rough barbaric clumsy furniture it seemed to them and made of wood they repeated many of the things they had said on the previous day and towards evening they found another flower a harebell in the late afternoon some company shepherds went down the river valley riding on a big multicycle; but they hid from them because their presence elizabeth said seemed to spoil the romance of this old-world place altogether
in this fashion they lived a week for all that week the days were cloudless and the nights nights of starry glory that were invaded each a little more by a crescent moon
yet something of the first splendour of their coming faded--faded imperceptibly day after day; dentons eloquence became fitful and lacked fresh topics of inspiration; the fatigue of their long march from london told in a certain stiffness of the limbs and each suffered from a slight unaccountable cold moreover denton became aware of unoccupied time in one place among the carelessly heaped lumber of the old times he found a rust-eaten spade and with this he made a fitful attack on the razed and grass-grown garden--though he had nothing to plant or sow he returned to elizabeth with a sweat-streaming face after half an hour of such work
there were giants in those days he said not understanding what wont and training will do and their walk that day led them along the hills until they could see the city shimmering far away in the valley i wonder how things are going on there he said
and then came a change in the weather come out and see the clouds she cried; and behold they were a sombre purple in the north and east streaming up to ragged edges at the zenith and as they went up the hill these hurrying streamers blotted out the sunset suddenly the wind set the beech-trees swaying and whispering and elizabeth shivered and then far away the lightning flashed flashed like a sword that is drawn suddenly and the distant thunder marched about the sky and even as they stood astonished pattering upon them came the first headlong raindrops of the storm in an instant the last streak of sunset was hidden by a falling curtain of hail and the lightning flashed again and the voice of the thunder roared louder and all about them the world scowled dark and strange
seizing hands these children of the city ran down the hill to their home in infinite astonishment and ere they reached it elizabeth was weeping with dismay and the darkling ground about them was white and brittle and active with the pelting hail
then began a strange and terrible night for them for the first time in their civilised lives they were in absolute darkness; they were wet and cold and shivering all about them hissed the hail and through the long neglected ceilings of the derelict home came noisy spouts of water and formed pools and rivulets on the creaking floors as the gusts of the storm struck the worn-out building it groaned and shuddered and now a mass of plaster from the wall would slide and smash and now some loosened tile would rattle down the roof and crash into the empty greenhouse below elizabeth shuddered and was still; denton wrapped his gay and flimsy city cloak about her and so they crouched in the darkness and ever the thunder broke louder and nearer and ever more lurid flashed the lightning jerking into a momentary gaunt clearness the steaming dripping room in which they sheltered
never before had they been in the open air save when the sun was shining all their time had been spent in the warm and airy ways and halls and rooms of the latter-day city it was to them that night as if they were in some other world some disordered chaos of stress and tumult and almost beyond hoping that they should ever see the city ways again
the storm seemed to last interminably until at last they dozed between the thunderclaps and then very swiftly it fell and ceased and as the last patter of the rain died away they heard an unfamiliar sound
what is that? cried elizabeth it came again it was the barking of dogs it drove down the desert lane and passed; and through the window whitening the wall before them and throwing upon it the shadow of the window-frame and of a tree in black silhouette shone the light of the waxing moon
just as the pale dawn was drawing the things about them into sight the fitful barking of dogs came near again and stopped they listened after a pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seeking round the house and short half-smothered barks then again everything was still
ssh whispered elizabeth and pointed to the door of their room
denton went half-way towards the door and stood listening he came back with a face of affected unconcern they must be the sheep-dogs of the food company he said they will do us no harm
he sat down again beside her what a night it has been he said to hide how keenly he was listening
i dont like dogs answered elizabeth after a long silence
dogs never hurt any one said denton in the old days--in the nineteenth century--everybody had a dog
there was a romance i heard once a dog killed a man
not this sort of dog said denton confidently some of those romances--are exaggerated
suddenly a half bark and a pattering up the staircase; the sound of panting denton sprang to his feet and drew the sword out of the damp straw upon which they had been lying then in the doorway appeared a gaunt sheep-dog and halted there behind it stared another for an instant man and brute faced each other hesitating
then denton being ignorant of dogs made a sharp step forward go away he said with a clumsy motion of his sword
the dog started and growled denton stopped sharply good dog he said
the growling jerked into a bark
good dog said denton the second dog growled and barked a third out of sight down the staircase took up the barking also outside others gave tongue--a large number it seemed to denton
this is annoying said denton without taking his eye off the brutes before him of course the shepherds wont come out of the city for hours yet naturally these dogs dont quite make us out
i cant hear shouted elizabeth she stood up and came to him
denton tried again but the barking still drowned his voice the sound had a curious effect upon his blood odd disused emotions began to stir; his face changed as he shouted he tried again; the barking seemed to mock him and one dog danced a pace forward bristling suddenly he turned and uttering certain words in the dialect of the underways words incomprehensible to elizabeth he made for the dogs there was a sudden cessation of the barking a growl and a snapping elizabeth saw the snarling head of the foremost dog its white teeth and retracted ears and the flash of the thrust blade the brute leapt into the air and was flung back
then denton with a shout was driving the dogs before him the sword flashed above his head with a sudden new freedom of gesture and then he vanished down the staircase she made six steps to follow him and on the landing there was blood she stopped and hearing the tumult of dogs and dentons shouts pass out of the house ran to the window
nine wolfish sheep-dogs were scattering one writhed before the porch; and denton tasting that strange delight of combat that slumbers still in the blood of even the most civilised man was shouting and running across the garden space and then she saw something that for a moment he did not see the dogs circled round this way and that and came again they had him in the open
in an instant she divined the situation she would have called to him for a moment she felt sick and helpless and then obeying a strange impulse she gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs in the hall was the rusting spade that was it she seized it and ran out
she came none too soon one dog rolled before him well-nigh slashed in half; but a second had him by the thigh a third gripped his collar behind and a fourth had the blade of the sword between its teeth tasting its own blood he parried the leap of a fifth with his left arm
it might have been the first century instead of the twenty-second so far as she was concerned all the gentleness of her eighteen years of city life vanished before this primordial need the spade smote hard and sure and cleft a dogs skull another crouching for a spring yelped with dismay at this unexpected antagonist and rushed aside two wasted precious moments on the binding of a feminine skirt
the collar of dentons cloak tore and parted as he staggered back; and that dog too felt the spade and ceased to trouble him he sheathed his sword in the brute at his thigh
to the wall cried elizabeth; and in three seconds the fight was at an end and our young people stood side by side while a remnant of five dogs with ears and tails of disaster fled shamefully from the stricken field
for a moment they stood panting and victorious and then elizabeth dropping her spade covered her face and sank to the ground in a paroxysm of weeping denton looked about him thrust the point of his sword into the ground so that it was at hand and stooped to comfort her
* * * * * at last their more tumultuous emotions subsided and they could talk again she leant upon the wall and he sat upon it so that he could keep an eye open for any returning dogs two at any rate were up on the hillside and keeping up a vexatious barking
she was tear-stained but not very wretched now because for half an hour he had been repeating that she was brave and had saved his life but a new fear was growing in her mind
they are the dogs of the food company she said there will be trouble
i am afraid so very likely they will prosecute us for trespass
a pause in the old times he said this sort of thing happened day after day
last night she said i could not live through another such night
he looked at her her face was pale for want of sleep and drawn and haggard he came to a sudden resolution we must go back he said
she looked at the dead dogs and shivered we cannot stay here she said
we must go back he repeated glancing over his shoulder to see if the enemy kept their distance we have been happy for a time but the world is too civilised ours is the age of cities more of this will kill us
but what are we to do? how can we live there?
denton hesitated his heel kicked against the wall on which he sat its a thing i havent mentioned before he said and coughed; but 
yes? you could raise money on your expectations he said
could i? she said eagerly of course you could what a child you are
she stood up and her face was bright why did you not tell me before? she asked and all this time we have been here
he looked at her for a moment and smiled then the smile vanished i thought it ought to come from you he said i didnt like to ask for your money and besides--at first i thought this would be rather fine
there was a pause it _has_ been fine he said; and glanced once more over his shoulder until all this began
yes she said those first days the first three days
they looked for a space into one anothers faces and then denton slid down from the wall and took her hand
to each generation he said the life of its time i see it all plainly now in the city--that is the life to which we were born to live in any other fashion  coming here was a dream and this--is the awakening
it was a pleasant dream she said--in the beginning
for a long space neither spoke
if we would reach the city before the shepherds come here we must start said denton we must get our food out of the house and eat as we go
denton glanced about him again and giving the dead dogs a wide berth they walked across the garden space and into the house together they found the wallet with their food and descended the blood-stained stairs again in the hall elizabeth stopped one minute she said there is something here
she led the way into the room in which that one little blue flower was blooming she stooped to it she touched it with her hand
i want it she said; and then i cannot take it
impulsively she stooped and kissed its petals
then silently side by side they went across the empty garden-space into the old high road and set their faces resolutely towards the distant city--towards the complex mechanical city of those latter days the city that had swallowed up mankind
one day a little girl named lily found a needle in her room she knew it was difficult to play with it because it was sharp lily wanted to share the needle with her mom so she could sew a button on her shirt
lily went to her mom and said mom i found this needle can you share it with me and sew my shirt? her mom smiled and said yes lily we can share the needle and fix your shirt

so he started to dance in the sky his graceful moves caused even the clouds to watch he spread his wings and flew higher higher and higher until he was just a dot in the sky
